      "question": "Muslim testator writes will: 'I give my entire estate to my wife, in accordance with Muslim Law, and no one can object to this.' Testator has 2 sons and 1 daughter (all adults). Is this will valid?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes - the phrase 'in accordance with Muslim Law' makes any provision valid.",
        "B": "No - testator can only give 1/3 of estate by will, and cannot give to existing Faraid beneficiaries (wife, children) without their consent.",
        "C": "Yes - wife and children are Faraid beneficiaries so they'll receive shares anyway, making the will redundant but valid.",
        "D": "No - Muslim wills cannot benefit spouses, only children and non-family members."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will is invalid. The notes provide this exact example: '1) I give everything to my Wife, in accordance with Muslim Law, and no one can object to this - Cannot give whole thing to wife, unless the other Faraid beneficiaries consent (assuming there are other beneficiaries). If no other beneficiaries, then Baitulmal will have a share. Adding in accordance with Muslim Law is ineffective to make an invalid Muslim will a valid one.' Two fundamental rules are violated: (1) The 1/3 rule - testators can only give up to 1/3 of their estate by will, with remaining 2/3 distributed via Faraid. Giving 'entire estate' exceeds this limit. (2) Faraid beneficiary restriction - the 1/3 testators can give by will must go to NON-Faraid beneficiaries (adopted children, stepchildren, friends, charities). Existing Faraid beneficiaries (wife, children) already get their shares from the 2/3 via Faraid rules, so testator cannot further gift to them from the 1/3. The testator could give more to wife or preferentially to children, but only with consent of all other Faraid beneficiaries. Adding 'in accordance with Muslim Law' doesn't cure these violations - it's a fig leaf that doesn't change the substance.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because adding the phrase 'in accordance with Muslim Law' does not validate an otherwise invalid will. The notes explicitly address this: 'Adding in accordance with Muslim Law is ineffective to make an invalid Muslim will a valid one.' The phrase is aspirational but legally meaningless if the actual provisions violate Muslim law. Muslim law (s 111 AMLA) requires: (1) testator can give only up to 1/3 of estate by will, (2) the 1/3 must go to non-Faraid beneficiaries (unless Faraid beneficiaries consent to receiving more). This will violates both rules by giving everything (not 1/3) to wife (a Faraid beneficiary). Simply stating compliance doesn't create compliance. If this magical phrase worked, every Muslim could evade the 1/3 rule by writing 'I give everything to X, in accordance with Muslim Law' - the rule would be meaningless. Courts assess actual substance, not formulaic language. The answer incorrectly treats a phrase as validating when substance is what matters.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it misunderstands the interaction between wills and Faraid. The wife and children will indeed receive shares via Faraid (from the 2/3 that passes by intestacy), but the testator's will is trying to give the wife the ENTIRE estate, not just her Faraid share. This is invalid. The will is not merely redundant - it's affirmatively void for attempting to give more than 1/3 (giving 100%) and to a Faraid beneficiary without others' consent. If the will said 'I give everything to charity' it would also be invalid (exceeds 1/3), but at least the beneficiary would be permissible (non-Faraid). Here, both the quantum (entire estate vs 1/3 limit) and the beneficiary (Faraid wife vs non-Faraid requirement) are wrong. The wife will get her Faraid share (perhaps 1/8 if there are children), and the children will get their Faraid shares (sons 2x daughters), but this is under intestacy rules, not under this invalid will. The will doesn't just become 'redundant' - it's void. The answer incorrectly treats invalidity as mere redundancy.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because it creates a categorical prohibition on benefiting spouses that's too broad. The rule is NOT that spouses can never benefit from wills. The rule is that the 1/3 testators can give by will must go to non-Faraid beneficiaries. The spouse is a Faraid beneficiary (already getting a share from the 2/3), so testator cannot give her additional benefits from the 1/3 without consent of other Faraid beneficiaries. However, the notes indicate: 'the 1/3 can be used to top up the shares of existing Faraid beneficiaries (like wives and daughters), but only with the consent of other living beneficiaries.' So spouse CAN benefit from the will if other Faraid beneficiaries consent. Without consent, the 1/3 must go to non-Faraid beneficiaries (adopted children, stepchildren, non-Muslim family, charities, friends). The answer incorrectly states an absolute prohibition on spousal benefits when the law allows it with consent. And the second part (only children and non-family members) is also wrong - the 1/3 can go to various non-Faraid beneficiaries, not just those categories."

      "question": "Muslim testator's will: 'If I do not return from Haj, my house shall belong to my adopted Daughter, with my other children getting nothing.' Testator has 2 biological children. Estate total value: $900,000. House value: $600,000. Is this valid?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes - adopted daughter is non-Faraid beneficiary so can receive bequest, and conditional bequest is valid.",
        "B": "No - testator cannot disinherit biological children under Muslim law, and house ($600k) exceeds 1/3 of estate ($300k).",
        "C": "Yes - the 1/3 rule allows giving $300k to adopted daughter, so house can be given if biological children consent.",
        "D": "No - conditional wills ('if I do not return from Haj') are void under s 111 AMLA."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will is invalid on two grounds. The notes provide this example: '2) If I do not return from Haj, my house shall belong to my adopted Daughter, with my other children getting nothing - Unlike civil law, you CANNOT disown or disinherit your children. You can give something to your adopted daughter, but only up to 1/3 and not at the expense of your lawful children. Can give more than 1/3 but would require consent of all beneficiaries.' First problem: the provision 'with my other children getting nothing' attempts to disinherit biological children. Under Muslim law (s 111 and 112 AMLA), children are prescribed Faraid beneficiaries who automatically inherit from the 2/3 that passes by intestacy rules. Testator cannot eliminate their shares. Second problem: the house ($600k) exceeds 1/3 of the estate (1/3 of $900k = $300k limit). The testator could give up to $300k to adopted daughter (who is non-Faraid), but $600k exceeds this. The testator could give the $600k house to adopted daughter if all Faraid beneficiaries (the 2 biological children) consent, but the will's language ('with my other children getting nothing') suggests no consent. Both violations make the will invalid.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This answer is correct that adopted daughter is a non-Faraid beneficiary (adopted children don't automatically inherit under Muslim law per the comparison table) who can receive bequests. However, it misses the two critical problems. First, the house ($600k) exceeds the 1/3 limit ($300k), so even to a permissible non-Faraid beneficiary, this gift is invalid without consent of other beneficiaries. Second, the phrase 'with my other children getting nothing' attempts disinheritance. The notes state: 'Unlike civil law, you CANNOT disown or disinherit your children.' The biological children will inherit via Faraid from the 2/3 regardless of what the will says. The testator cannot eliminate their entitlement. While conditional bequests may be valid under Muslim law generally, this particular will is invalid due to quantum (exceeds 1/3) and attempted disinheritance (biological children cannot be cut out). The answer incorrectly focuses on adopted daughter's eligibility while missing the 1/3 violation and disinheritance prohibition.",
          "C": "This answer correctly identifies that the house exceeds 1/3 ($600k vs $300k limit) and that consent could cure this. However, it misses the disinheritance problem. The will states 'with my other children getting nothing' - this is an attempted disinheritance that's invalid under Muslim law. The notes state: 'you CANNOT disown or disinherit your children.' Even with consent of biological children to the adopted daughter receiving the $600k house (more than 1/3), the children cannot consent to being disinherited entirely. They are Faraid beneficiaries entitled to shares from the 2/3 intestacy pool. The will could be valid if it said: 'My house ($600k) to adopted daughter, with this requiring consent of my biological children' without the disinheritance language. But the actual language ('other children getting nothing') makes it invalid. The biological children will get their Faraid shares from the remaining $300k ($900k estate - $600k house, assuming house gift were valid). The answer misses the disinheritance prohibition.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because conditional wills are not automatically void. The condition 'if I do not return from Haj' is a condition subsequent (if testator dies during Haj, will operates; if testator returns safely, will doesn't operate). Such conditions are generally permissible - testators can make bequests contingent on circumstances. There's nothing in s 111 AMLA or the notes suggesting conditional wills are prohibited. The problem with this will is not the condition but the substance: (1) attempting to disinherit biological children (invalid), and (2) giving asset worth $600k when only 1/3 = $300k is permitted without consent. If the will said 'If I do not return from Haj, I give $200,000 to my adopted daughter' (no disinheritance language, amount within 1/3), the condition would be fine. The answer incorrectly identifies the condition as the problem when the actual problems are quantum and disinheritance."

      "options": {
        "A": "Yes - testator is free to distribute property to own children as desired.",
        "B": "No - this violates the 1/3 rule as total gifts ($6M) far exceed 1/3 of estate.",
        "C": "No - cannot give specific assets to Faraid beneficiaries (children) from will; would require Deed of Family Arrangement with all children's written consent.",
        "D": "Yes - equal value to all children ($3M + $2M + $1M = $6M ÷ 3 = $2M each) satisfies fairness requirement."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will is invalid without consent. The notes provide this exact example: '3) I give 1 house at Jalan Avocado (valued at $3M) to my first Daughter, my other house at Banana Road (valued at $2M) to my second Daughter and my condo at Coconut Drive (valued at $1M) to my only Son - This is not allowed because the son and daughters are Faraid beneficiaries and would accordingly receive 2/3 of the total estate, so not allowed to further will things to them (by default). Would be allowed if all 3 of them consented to this arrangement in writing (to prove consent) via a Deed of Family Arrangement.' The children are Faraid beneficiaries who will automatically receive shares from the 2/3 intestacy portion. The testator cannot use the 1/3 bequeathable portion to give additional benefits to them. If the testator wants to give specific properties to specific children (deviating from default Faraid distribution), this requires all children's written consent via Deed of Family Arrangement. The consent allows parties to contract out of Faraid, but it must be documented. Without consent, the will is invalid for attempting to benefit Faraid beneficiaries from the 1/3 portion.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because testators are NOT free to distribute property to their own children as desired - children are Faraid beneficiaries with prescribed shares. The notes emphasize: 'Unlike civil law, you CANNOT disown or disinherit your children.' While this example doesn't disinherit (all children get something), it attempts to dictate specific distributions to Faraid beneficiaries, which requires consent. Under default Faraid rules, the son would get double each daughter's share. This will gives: Daughter 1 = $3M, Daughter 2 = $2M, Son = $1M - the son actually gets LESS than daughters, violating the 2:1 rule. More fundamentally, the testator cannot use the 1/3 bequeathable portion to benefit Faraid beneficiaries (children). The 1/3 must go to non-Faraid beneficiaries; the 2/3 automatically goes to children via Faraid. To deviate from this, the testator needs all children's consent via Deed of Family Arrangement. The answer incorrectly suggests testamentary freedom that Muslim law restricts.",
          "B": "This answer identifies that $6M exceeds 1/3, but this is not the primary issue. If the estate is $6M total, then 1/3 = $2M. The will gives away all $6M, which does exceed $2M. However, the notes' example focuses on a different problem: giving to Faraid beneficiaries. The will is not trying to give 1/3 to charity (which would trigger the quantum issue) but rather to give specific properties to children. The children are Faraid beneficiaries who will receive the 2/3 anyway via Faraid rules. The testator cannot also give them the 1/3 portion. While the quantum issue exists (cannot give more than 1/3 to anyone without consent), the conceptual problem is beneficiary selection (cannot give 1/3 to Faraid beneficiaries). If the will said 'I give $1.5M to my adopted daughter' (within 1/3, non-Faraid beneficiary), that would be valid. Here, the answer focuses on quantum when the beneficiary issue is more fundamental.",
          "D": "This is incorrect on multiple levels. First, the arithmetic is wrong: $3M + $2M + $1M = $6M total, but dividing by 3 = $2M average per child, not equal distribution (they're getting $3M, $2M, and $1M respectively - very unequal). Second, even if distribution were mathematically equal, this doesn't cure the invalidity. The problem is not inequality among children, but rather that the testator is attempting to benefit Faraid beneficiaries (children) from the 1/3 bequeathable portion. The 1/3 must go to non-Faraid beneficiaries unless Faraid beneficiaries consent. Third, there's no 'fairness requirement' that equal distribution automatically validates a will. Under Faraid, sons get double daughters' shares (2:1 ratio) - inequality is built into the system. The answer incorrectly suggests equal distribution cures the problem when the real issue is beneficiary selection (Faraid vs non-Faraid) and lack of consent."

      "options": {
        "A": "Dispose of entire estate freely, subject only to Wills Act formalities.",
        "B": "Dispose of up to 1/3 of estate, subject to restrictions of the Muslim law school they profess.",

        "D": "Can dispose freely if all Faraid beneficiaries consent in writing."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Testators can dispose of up to 1/3 of estate, subject to Muslim law restrictions. Section 111 AMLA states: 'no Muslim domiciled in Singapore may, after 1 July 1968, dispose of his or her property by will except in accordance with the provisions of and subject to the restrictions imposed by the school of Muslim law professed by him or her.' The key restrictions are: (1) can bequeath only up to 1/3 of estate (remaining 2/3 goes via Faraid), (2) the 1/3 must go to non-Faraid beneficiaries unless Faraid beneficiaries consent, and (3) formalities of Wills Act must be complied with (except s 3(1) Wills Act doesn't apply to distribution). The reference to 'school of Muslim law professed' recognizes that different schools (Shafii, Hanafi, etc.) might have variations, though the 1/3 rule is universal. The post-1968 date is when this law took effect. Before July 1, 1968, Muslims might have had more freedom; after, s 111 applies. The section balances testamentary freedom (can give 1/3) with family protection (2/3 reserved for Faraid beneficiaries).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because Muslims do NOT have freedom to dispose of their entire estate. Section 111 AMLA explicitly restricts testamentary disposition: testators can dispose only 'in accordance with the provisions of and subject to the restrictions imposed by the school of Muslim law professed'. The primary restriction is the 1/3 rule - only 1/3 can be willed, with 2/3 going via Faraid. The notes emphasize: 'The testator can give only up to 1/3 of his estate in their will (Rationale in Quran: testator's primary obligation is to his family, so 2/3 is reserved to them).' If testators could dispose of entire estates freely, the Faraid system would be optional, which contradicts s 112 AMLA's mandate that intestacy follows Muslim law. The answer incorrectly suggests testamentary freedom limited only by formalities when substantive restrictions (1/3 rule, beneficiary restrictions) also apply.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it goes to the opposite extreme - Muslim wills ARE permitted, just restricted. Section 111 AMLA regulates how Muslims can make wills ('may... dispose... by will except in accordance with... Muslim law'), which presupposes wills are allowed. If wills were prohibited, the section would say 'Muslims may not dispose by will' rather than regulating how they do so. The notes extensively discuss Muslim wills, the 1/3 rule, formalities, valid uses (giving to adopted children, stepchildren, charities), and invalid examples. This entire framework would be unnecessary if wills were prohibited. The reality is: 2/3 of estate follows Faraid (mandatory), 1/3 can be disposed by will (optional). Testators can choose not to make wills (entire estate follows Faraid), but they have the option to will up to 1/3. The answer incorrectly prohibits wills when they're actually permitted within limits.",
          "D": "This answer is partially correct but overstates what consent achieves. With all Faraid beneficiaries' consent, the testator can give MORE than 1/3 (e.g., give 50% to charity if beneficiaries agree), or give the 1/3 TO Faraid beneficiaries (e.g., top up wife's share). But even with consent, testators cannot dispose 'freely' of the entire estate in all respects. For example, the consent might allow exceeding 1/3, but cannot override other Muslim law requirements (like testators cannot give everything to charity leaving nothing for family, even with current beneficiaries' consent, as future potential beneficiaries or Baitulmal have interests). The answer suggests unlimited freedom with consent when consent allows deviation from 1/3 and beneficiary rules but doesn't eliminate all restrictions. Additionally, the answer doesn't capture the default rule - most testators don't have all beneficiaries' consent when writing wills. The baseline answer should be about the 1/3 rule, with consent as an exception/expansion, not presenting consent as the primary rule."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The brother gets the CPF as nominee. The case of Saniah Ali v Abdullah Ali [1990] held that CPF moneys with nomination do NOT form part of the deceased's estate and are not subject to s 112 AMLA. The court stated: 'moneys in the CPF... are specifically excluded from the estate of the deceased, and that being so, the moneys do not form part of the estate of the deceased member and are therefore not subject to s 112(1) of the AMLA; in other words, that section does not apply to those moneys.' This is express exclusion in the CPF Act itself. Initially, a Fatwa held that nominees hold CPF on trust for Faraid beneficiaries, but this Fatwa was 'merely an opinion... and not binding on the Court.' The 2010 Fatwa revision changed the position: 'Fatwa on CPF was updated on 3 August 2010 to permit nomination as a new form of hibah (gift). Under the new Fatwa, the CPF member could choose to nominate or distribute according to Faraid, or exercise both options together. CPF nomination equals to hibah (gift).' So the brother receives $500k as gift (hibah), not as trust. The harmonization between civil law (CPF Act exclusion) and Muslim law (hibah) is complete.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is directly contradicted by Saniah Ali. The case explicitly held that CPF moneys with nomination 'do not form part of the estate of the deceased' and 's 112(1) of the AMLA... does not apply to those moneys.' The CPF Act specifically excludes nominated CPF from the estate - this is statutory, not subject to override by s 112 AMLA. If CPF were part of the estate subject to Faraid, the nomination system would be meaningless for Muslims (they could nominate but nominees wouldn't receive because Faraid would override). The answer represents the argument made by the losing party in Saniah Ali (Abdullah argued CPF should follow Faraid), which the court rejected. The policy is that CPF nomination is a valid property disposition mechanism available to all Singaporeans including Muslims, and AMLA's intestacy rules don't override CPF Act provisions. The answer incorrectly suggests s 112 AMLA applies to nominated CPF when Saniah Ali and the CPF Act exclude such CPF from estates.",
          "C": "This represents the OLD Fatwa position that was revised in 2010. The notes explain: 'there was a fatwa at the time that said that the nominee would only hold the CPF monies as a trustee on behalf of the Faraid beneficiary.' However, the court in Saniah Ali rejected this, holding that a 'Fatwa is merely an opinion of the Fatwa Committee of the Majlis (MUIS) and not binding on the Court.' The legal position based on CPF Act was that nominees receive CPF beneficially, not as trustees. Subsequently, the Fatwa itself was revised: 'Fatwa on CPF Monies was subsequently revised. Fatwa on CPF was updated on 3 August 2010 to permit nomination as a new form of hibah (gift)... CPF nomination equals to hibah (gift).' Under the current legal and religious position, the brother receives CPF as a gift, not as trustee. The answer incorrectly applies outdated Fatwa that was both judicially rejected (Saniah Ali) and subsequently revised (2010).",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no 50-50 split principle for CPF. The law is clear: nominated CPF goes entirely to the nominee (brother gets all $500k), not partially to nominee and partially to Faraid beneficiaries. The CPF Act excludes nominated CPF from the estate - it doesn't partially exclude it. Section 25(1) CPF Act (formerly s 24(1)) provides that nominated CPF moneys 'shall not form part of the estate of the deceased member' and are paid to nominees. This is all-or-nothing: either CPF was nominated (goes to nominee), or it wasn't (goes to estate/Faraid). There's no mechanism for splitting nominated CPF between nominee and estate beneficiaries. If the deceased wanted Faraid beneficiaries to receive CPF, he shouldn't have made a nomination (CPF would then go to estate and be distributed via Faraid). The answer incorrectly invents an equitable split that has no basis in CPF Act or AMLA."

        "correct": "The property did not form part of the deceased's estate. The Court of Appeal agreed with the outcome but disagreed with the High Court's reasoning. CA held: 'The question as to what assets constitute the estate and effects of a deceased Muslim has first to be determined according to his personal law... and not according to the common law.' However, CA then analyzed joint tenancy under Muslim law and Land Titles Act. Under the Land Titles Act (civil law), when one joint tenant dies, the property doesn't 'pass' to the survivor - it 'morphs' from joint ownership to sole ownership. The CA stated: 'there is no passing of the property. Instead, property had morphed from joint into sole-ownership upon death of joint owner, hence nothing to distribute. Therefore, s 112 AMLA did not apply.' The critical insight is that because the property never formed part of the deceased's estate (it morphed to sole ownership), s 112 AMLA (which governs distribution of estate) had nothing to operate on. Additionally, CA studied Muslim law authorities and found joint tenancy is now validly recognized under Muslim law, harmonizing civil and Muslim law.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This represents an argument made in the case but rejected by the Court of Appeal. The administrators argued that 'the concept of joint-tenancy and the operation of right-survivorship is repugnant to Muslim law as it increased her (deceased's wife) share in the estate.' Some interpretations of Muslim law viewed joint tenancy as problematic because it circumvents Faraid distribution. However, the CA held that joint tenancy is validly recognized under Muslim law after studying authorities. The notes state: 'A joint tenancy is now a validly recognized contract under Muslim law so the law between civil and Muslim law is harmonized.' The CA didn't ignore joint tenancy as repugnant; instead, it validated joint tenancy under both civil and Muslim law. The answer incorrectly suggests the CA rejected joint tenancy when it actually upheld the joint tenancy arrangement and found it consistent with Muslim law.",
          "C": "This represents the 2007 Fatwa's position, which was not adopted by the Court of Appeal. A 2007 Fatwa stated 'that joint tenancy is not recognized under Muslim Law (i.e. each co-owner of a joint property had a fixed share which should be distributed to his legal beneficiaries)'. However, the CA in Shafeeq did not follow this Fatwa. As established in Saniah Ali, Fatwas are opinions not binding on courts. The CA independently analyzed Muslim law authorities and concluded that joint tenancy is validly recognized under Muslim law. Additionally, even if joint tenancy were problematic from a Muslim law perspective, the CA's analysis showed that under Land Titles Act, the property morphed (didn't pass), so s 112 AMLA didn't apply anyway. The answer incorrectly suggests the CA held joint tenancy violates Faraid when the CA actually harmonized the two, finding joint tenancy consistent with Muslim law.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because it misunderstands the joint tenancy mechanism. Joint tenancy is not the same as tenancy in common. In tenancy in common, each party owns a distinct share (e.g., 50-50), and upon death, the deceased's share passes to their estate/beneficiaries. The answer's description (50% to estate, 50% by survivorship) would apply to tenancy in common, not joint tenancy. In joint tenancy, there are no distinct shares - the joint tenants together own the whole property. Upon one joint tenant's death, the entire property belongs to the survivor by operation of law (right of survivorship). Nothing 'passes' - the property 'morphs' from joint to sole ownership. This is the CA's key point in Shafeeq: because nothing passes, s 112 AMLA (governing distribution of estate) has nothing to operate on. The entire property is the wife's by survivorship; zero percent forms part of husband's estate. The answer incorrectly applies tenancy in common concepts to a joint tenancy situation."

        "correct": "No, daughter cannot enforce the hibah. The High Court held: 'Refused to comment on whether the Hibah was valid or not. Instead cited s50 HDB Act - transfer of flat without consent of HDB was void. Thus, MUIS's opinion that the hibah was valid under Muslim law was pointless and not binding on this court which had full jurisdiction to decide on the matter in issue.' The key principle: 'no matter what instrument you use in Muslim law, it must be seen in light of other legislation.' The HDB Act requires HDB's consent for any transfer of HDB flats. The mother's hibah (gift) in India purported to transfer the flat to daughter without HDB approval. Even if the hibah was perfectly valid under Muslim law (meeting all Islamic law requirements), it's void under the HDB Act for non-compliance with transfer procedures. Muslim law instruments (hibah, wills, deeds) cannot override other Singapore statutes. The daughter might have a valid gift under Muslim law, but she cannot get the HDB flat without complying with HDB Act requirements. The case illustrates that Muslim law operates within Singapore's overall legal framework, not above it.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores the HDB Act requirement. While MUIS opined that the hibah was valid under Muslim law, the High Court 'refused to comment on whether the Hibah was valid or not', instead focusing on HDB Act non-compliance. Even assuming the hibah is valid under Muslim law (meeting all requirements for a valid Islamic gift), this doesn't give the daughter the flat if the transfer violates the HDB Act. The HDB Act s 50 makes transfers without HDB consent void. The Muslim law validity is irrelevant if another statute prohibits the transfer. The notes emphasize: 'no matter what instrument you use in Muslim law, it must be seen in light of other legislation.' If Muslim law instruments could override general statutes, it would create a separate legal system immune from regular laws, which is not Singapore's framework. The answer incorrectly treats Muslim law validity as sufficient when compliance with all applicable laws (including HDB Act) is required.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it applies the 1/3 rule (which applies to wills) to hibah (gifts). Hibah is a gift made during lifetime or as hibah ruqba (conditional on death). The 1/3 rule in s 111 AMLA states: 'testator can give only up to 1/3 of his estate in their will.' This limits testamentary dispositions (what you give by will after death). Hibah, being a gift (whether lifetime or conditional on death), operates differently - it's not subject to the same 1/3 restriction. If the hibah were valid and compliant with HDB Act, the daughter could receive the entire flat, not just 1/3. The problem here is not the 1/3 rule but rather the HDB Act non-compliance. The notes don't indicate hibah are limited to 1/3 - that's a will-specific restriction. The answer incorrectly applies testamentary restrictions to lifetime gifts/hibah, conflating different Islamic law instruments with different rules.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the location where hibah was signed (India) is not the problem. The High Court's holding was based on HDB Act non-compliance, not on the hibah being executed overseas. If the hibah had been signed in Singapore, it would still be void for HDB Act purposes (transfer without HDB consent). The issue is not geographic (India vs Singapore) or validation by SYC, but substantive compliance with the HDB Act. Muslim law instruments (hibah, wills, etc.) must comply with other Singapore laws regardless of where the instrument was executed. A hibah signed in India can be valid under Muslim law and recognized in Singapore (we're not talking about foreign court orders that might need recognition), but like any other instrument purporting to transfer HDB property, it must comply with HDB Act requirements. The answer incorrectly focuses on location/validation when the issue is substantive compliance with HDB transfer restrictions."

Section 115(1) AMLA provides: 'The SYC will issue an Inheritance Certificate setting out the persons entitled to the estate of the deceased, and in what proportion. This Inheritance Certificate must be submitted with all other relevant documents when filing for Grant of Letters of Administration at the FJC.' The SYC Certificate lists beneficiaries and shares based on the deceased's school of Islamic law (usually Shafii in Singapore).

The notes emphasize this is mandatory: 'you MUST obtain an Inheritance Cert first from SYC... This Inheritance Cert MUST be filed together with all other papers.' Section 115(1) AMLA makes this statutory requirement. The policy rationale is to ensure Faraid rules are properly calculated and applied. The SYC has expertise in Islamic law and knows how to apply Faraid based on the deceased's school (Shafii, Hanafi, etc.). Without the Certificate, FJC/HC wouldn't know who should inherit and in what proportions under Muslim law. The answer incorrectly treats Muslim estate applications as identical to non-Muslim applications when there's an additional SYC Certificate requirement.",

This is so regardless whether there is a will, Deed of Family Arrangement, etc.' The word 'MUST' indicates it's mandatory, not optional. Section 115(1) AMLA requires the Inheritance Certificate to be submitted with all other relevant documents. The application cannot proceed without it. The FJC/HC will not issue grant of probate/LOA for a Muslim estate without the SYC Inheritance Certificate showing who is entitled and in what shares under Faraid. This is not optional SYC 'approval' but a mandatory certificate documenting beneficiaries and shares. The answer incorrectly treats a mandatory statutory requirement as optional, which would result in applications being rejected for incompleteness.",

The notes state: 'The SYC will issue an Inheritance Certificate' and provide online application info via www.syariahcourt.gov.sg. The Certificate does include information about beneficiaries and their Faraid shares, but also confirms the deceased's school of Islamic law (which determines specific share calculations). While confirming Muslim status might be implicit, the primary purpose is not status confirmation but rather calculating and certifying the Faraid distribution. The answer incorrectly attributes the certificate to MUIS rather than SYC and somewhat mischaracterizes its primary purpose (beneficiary shares, not just status confirmation)."

The notes explain s 112 applies to 'any Muslim person domiciled in Singapore dying intestate' - the deceased must be Muslim. Here, the mother was non-Muslim, so her estate follows regular civil law (Intestate Succession Act, Wills Act). The Convert can inherit from the non-Muslim mother under civil law - there's no restriction preventing Muslims from inheriting from non-Muslims under civil law. The mother's will leaving everything to her child (the Convert) is valid under the Wills Act. The restriction runs the other direction: when a Muslim deceased dies leaving non-Muslim heirs (like a convert whose family is non-Muslim), those non-Muslim heirs cannot inherit via Faraid. The notes give an example: 'A convert who dies leaving only non-Muslim heirs and did not provide for this under the will' - the share goes to Baitulmal because non-Muslims cannot be Faraid beneficiaries. But when a non-Muslim dies leaving Muslim heirs, civil law (not Muslim law) applies, and civil law doesn't restrict inheritance based on religion.",

Faraid doesn't apply here because Faraid only governs estates of Muslim deceased persons (s 112 AMLA). The mother was non-Muslim, so Faraid is irrelevant. The Convert inherits under civil law: mother's will under Wills Act, or if intestate, under Intestate Succession Act. There's no Faraid calculation involved. The answer's confusion between inheriting 'under mother's will' (correct - civil law) and 'under Faraid' (incorrect - doesn't apply to non-Muslim deceased) shows misunderstanding of when AMLA inheritance provisions apply. The trigger for AMLA is deceased being Muslim, not heir being Muslim. The answer conflates the two situations.",
          "B": "This is incorrect on both points. First, there's no rule that Muslims cannot inherit from non-Muslims under civil law. When a non-Muslim dies, civil law applies (Intestate Succession Act for intestacy, Wills Act for wills). Civil law doesn't restrict inheritance based on heir's religion - a Muslim child can inherit from non-Muslim parent, a Buddhist can inherit from Christian, etc. Second, Baitulmal only receives shares from MUSLIM deceased's estates when there are no Faraid beneficiaries or unclaimed shares. Baitulmal is part of the Muslim inheritance system under AMLA. For non-Muslim estates, there's no Baitulmal involvement. If a non-Muslim dies intestate with no relatives, the estate would go to the Singapore government under civil law unclaimed property rules, not to Baitulmal. The answer incorrectly applies Muslim law restrictions (and Baitulmal) to a non-Muslim deceased's estate when civil law applies.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the 1/3 rule (s 111 AMLA) applies to Muslim testators' wills, not to inheritance from non-Muslim deceased. The mother was non-Muslim, so s 111 AMLA doesn't apply to her will. She can dispose of her entire estate by will under the Wills Act without the 1/3 restriction. The 1/3 rule is a restriction on Muslim testators, not on non-Muslim testators or on Muslim beneficiaries receiving from non-Muslim estates. If the answer were correct, non-Muslims couldn't effectively give to their Muslim children/relatives (limited to 1/3), which would be absurd and discriminatory. Civil law applies to non-Muslim estates with no such restrictions. The mother's will giving everything to her Convert child is valid under civil law.

Muslim law' (1/3 rule applies). Section 112 states: 'In the case of any Muslim person domiciled in Singapore dying intestate, the estate and effects shall be distributed according to the Muslim Law' (Faraid applies). The domicile requirement means: (1) Muslims domiciled in Singapore must follow AMLA rules (1/3 limit on wills, Faraid for intestacy), (2) Muslims domiciled elsewhere are not subject to Singapore AMLA (their wills/estates follow the law of their domicile). The notes mention: 'No caselaw on the domicile requirement. Domicile requirement is slightly tricky because AMLA makes no distinction between foreigners and Singapore citizens. The practice now is to apply the law of the country of origin.' So a Malaysian Muslim domiciled in Malaysia who dies in Singapore would have estate distributed per Malaysian law, not Singapore Faraid.

        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it confuses domicile with citizenship. Domicile is a legal concept referring to one's permanent home/residence, not citizenship status. A person can be domiciled in Singapore without being a citizen (e.g., permanent resident who intends to live here permanently, or foreigner who's made Singapore their permanent home). Conversely, a Singapore citizen might be domiciled elsewhere (e.g., emigrated to Australia and established domicile there). Section 111 and 112 use 'domiciled in Singapore', not 'Singapore citizens', because domicile determines connection to Singapore for private international law purposes. The notes specifically mention: 'AMLA makes no distinction between foreigners and Singapore citizens' - what matters is domicile, not nationality. A foreign Muslim domiciled in Singapore is subject to AMLA, while a Singapore citizen Muslim domiciled abroad is not. The answer incorrectly treats citizenship as determinative when it's actually domicile.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because domicile and school of Muslim law are separate concepts. Domicile determines WHETHER AMLA applies (domiciled in Singapore = AMLA applies; domiciled elsewhere = foreign law applies). School of Muslim law determines HOW Faraid is calculated within AMLA framework (Shafii school has certain share ratios, Hanafi school might differ slightly). Section 113 AMLA addresses school: 'In all applications for probate and letters of administration the affidavit supporting the application shall, in the case of a deceased Muslim, state the school of law (Mazhab) which the deceased professed.' The school is usually determined by the deceased's practice/family tradition (most Singaporean Muslims are Shafii), not by domicile. A Malaysian Muslim domiciled in Singapore (AMLA applies) might profess Shafii school. A Singaporean Muslim domiciled in Singapore (AMLA applies) might profess Hanafi school. Domicile and school are independent variables. The answer incorrectly conflates them.",
          "D": "This is entirely incorrect - it invents a requirement that foreign Muslims must have wills. There's no such requirement. Foreign Muslims can die intestate (without wills). The question is whether AMLA's intestacy rules (s 112 Faraid distribution) apply or their home country's rules apply. If a foreign Muslim is domiciled in Singapore, s 112 AMLA applies (Faraid distribution). If domiciled elsewhere, that country's law applies. The notes indicate 'practice now is to apply the law of the country of origin' for foreign Muslims, suggesting their home country intestacy law applies if domiciled there. Muslims (foreign or local) are not required to have wills - intestacy is always a possibility when someone dies without a will.

Muslim Law need not be proved like foreign law. Muslim law is part of the law of the land which the Court would take cognizance... while the English translation of wakaf is a charitable trust, it is wrong to apply common law of trusts to a wakaf. Instead, as was done by Justice Judith Prakash at the High Court below, the Court must apply Muslim Law in determining whether a wakaf had been created.' This is significant: Muslim law is not foreign law requiring expert proof - it's part of Singapore law that courts are expected to know and apply. The elements for wakaf under Muslim law are: (i) dedication of property for pious/religious/charitable purposes, (ii) inalienability of subject matter, and (iii) permanent dedication. The court applied these Muslim law elements, not common law charitable trust elements, showing respect for Muslim law's distinct concepts within Singapore's legal system.",

Wakaf under Muslim law has different elements, requirements, and consequences than a charitable trust under common law. For example, the inalienability requirement in wakaf (property cannot be sold) is stricter than common law charitable trusts. If the court applied common law charitable trust principles, it might reach different conclusions about validity, revocability, or property rights. The notes emphasize: 'whether or not it is a wakaf cannot be based on common law but on Muslim Law.' The court must apply authentic Muslim law principles, not common law analogies. The answer incorrectly treats translation equivalence as legal equivalence, when the court insisted on applying genuine Muslim law.",

While MUIS is a religious authority and its views are entitled to respect, courts independently apply Muslim law. The case shows the court engaged with Muslim law authorities and made its own determination about whether a wakaf existed. Similarly, in Saniah Ali, the court held that a 'Fatwa is merely an opinion of the Fatwa Committee of the Majlis (MUIS) and not binding on the Court.' This principle applies broadly: MUIS's religious opinions inform but don't bind courts. Courts have jurisdiction to interpret and apply Muslim law as part of Singapore law. The separation between religious authority (MUIS) and judicial authority (courts) ensures proper rule of law - courts, not religious bodies, have final say on legal questions. If courts simply deferred to MUIS, it would be an improper delegation of judicial function. The answer incorrectly suggests judicial deference when courts independently apply Muslim law.",

While the Land Titles Act (civil property law) was relevant to the case (dealing with registered property and title transfer), the court didn't apply Land Titles Act alone without considering Muslim law. The issue was whether the property was wakaf, which is a Muslim law concept that affects property rights. The court stated: 'whether or not it is a wakaf cannot be based on common law but on Muslim Law.' The court applied Muslim law to determine if wakaf existed, then considered how this affects property rights under the Land Titles Act. Muslim law and civil law both applied: Muslim law to characterize the property interest (wakaf or not), Land Titles Act to determine transfer validity.

The sequence matters: deceased wrote Letter of Wishes (not binding itself, just expressing desire for equal shares), children entered Deed of Family Arrangement implementing this (legally binding agreement), son who initially agreed later had regrets and wanted to renege. The CA enforced the agreement. The principle is important: while Faraid is the default distribution, beneficiaries can agree among themselves to deviate from default shares. This is contracting out of Muslim law, but it's permissible when done knowingly and by agreement. The Fatwa Committee of MUIS endorsed this: 'an act of renunciation and redistribution which is agreed upon by the heirs' consensus is allowed under Islamic law.'

The word 'knowingly' is key - parties must understand they're deviating from Faraid, but if they do so voluntarily, the agreement prevails. This makes practical sense: if beneficiaries cannot agree to redistribute, it would prevent estate planning flexibility and force families to accept distributions they all find unsatisfactory. The law allows consensual deviation while prohibiting unilateral deviation (testator alone cannot override Faraid without beneficiaries' consent).

A Letter of Wishes is not a will - it's an expression of the deceased's preferences that's not legally binding itself. It doesn't purport to dispose of property or override Faraid. The deceased wasn't trying to 'will' the entire estate contrary to the 1/3 rule. Instead, the deceased expressed a wish for equal distribution, and the actual mechanism for implementing this was the children's Deed of Family Arrangement (legally binding contract among beneficiaries). The children, as beneficiaries entitled to Faraid shares, agreed to redistribute equally rather than following 2:1 ratio. The Letter of Wishes was the motivation for the Deed, but the Deed (not the Letter) is what created legal obligations. Even if the Letter were somehow invalid, the Deed would still be enforceable as an agreement among the beneficiaries.

The Deed of Family Arrangement is precisely such an agreement. All 6 children (including the now-challenging son) initially agreed to equal distribution, deviating from the 2:1 Faraid default. Under contract law and the principle from Shiraz Husain, this agreement is binding. The son cannot unilaterally renege after agreeing. The answer incorrectly treats the Faraid 2:1 ratio as mandatory and immutable when it's actually a default that beneficiaries can consensually vary through Deed of Family Arrangement.

Must take into consideration the financial situation of his/her beneficiaries and who is in need of the money. Nomination cannot be made with the intention of denying the rights of other beneficiaries.' While the Fatwa is not legally binding (per Saniah Ali - Fatwas are opinions), it provides religious/ethical guidance. Legally, CPF nominations are unrestricted (can nominate anyone), but the Fatwa counsels Muslims to nominate thoughtfully, considering: which beneficiaries need financial support most, not using nomination spitefully to deny certain family members, balancing between nomination (which bypasses Faraid) and allowing CPF to go to estate (distributed via Faraid). For example, if one child is disabled and needs support while others are financially independent, nominating to the disabled child is prudent. But nominating to punish certain children by denying them inheritance might be religiously improper even if legally valid.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This answer is legally correct but religiously incomplete. Under CPF Act and Saniah Ali, nominations are indeed legally unrestricted - CPF members can nominate anyone (family, friends, charities) for any amount without legal limitations. However, the 2010 Fatwa (while not legally binding) provides religious/ethical guidance for Muslims. The Fatwa counsels that CPF members 'must take into consideration the financial situation of his/her beneficiaries and who is in need of the money' and 'Nomination cannot be made with the intention of denying the rights of other beneficiaries.' While violating these Fatwa guidelines doesn't make the nomination legally invalid, it may be religiously inappropriate. A Muslim who nominates spitefully or without considering need might be committing a sin (though the nomination is legally effective). The answer incorrectly focuses solely on legal validity while ignoring the religious/ethical dimension that the Fatwa introduces.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it misunderstands the purpose of the 2010 Fatwa. The Fatwa permits nomination as hibah (gift), recognizing that nominations bypass Faraid entirely. If CPF members were required to nominate Faraid beneficiaries in Faraid ratios, nominations would be pointless - the same result would occur whether CPF is nominated or goes to estate. The whole point of allowing nominations is giving Muslims flexibility to deviate from Faraid based on need and circumstances. The Fatwa permits nominating to: non-Faraid beneficiaries (like adopted children), single Faraid beneficiary (like a disabled child needing support), or Faraid beneficiaries in non-Faraid ratios (equal shares to sons and daughters). The only constraint is the intention/need consideration - think about who needs support, don't nominate maliciously. The answer incorrectly imposes Faraid ratio requirements that would defeat the nomination system's purpose.",
          "D": "This is entirely incorrect on multiple levels. First, CPF can definitely go to Muslims - there's no prohibition. Most CPF nominations likely name Muslim family members. Second, the premise about Faraid is backwards: Faraid applies to Muslims, not non-Muslims. When a Muslim dies, Faraid beneficiaries (spouse, children, parents - who are Muslim) inherit via Faraid. Non-Muslims cannot be Faraid beneficiaries. If anything, Muslims would be the natural CPF nomination beneficiaries for Muslim CPF members, not prohibited from receiving. Third, the 2010 Fatwa specifically allows flexible nomination (including to Muslims) - the constraint is about thoughtful consideration of need, not about beneficiary religion. The answer completely inverts the law, incorrectly prohibiting Muslim beneficiaries when they're actually the typical and permissible recipients."

A male who chooses to accept the extra inheritance portion must realise that the rights, comes with added responsibility. This being the responsibility for the male member to provide for the female member's living and to secure their welfare. It is now possible for males to renounce their double shares voluntarily. One would argue then should the male not be ready to shoulder this right, they may consider renouncing their additional portion and instead share it with their female relatives. Such an act of renunciation and redistribution which is agreed upon by the heirs' consensus is allowed under Islamic law as declared by the Fatwa Committee of MUIS.' This creates flexibility: the 2:1 ratio is default, but if male heirs feel it's unfair in their circumstances or don't want the responsibility that comes with extra shares, they can renounce. The renunciation must be voluntary and typically requires consensus/agreement among heirs (similar to Deed of Family Arrangement in Shiraz Husain).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it treats Faraid as immutable when it's actually a default subject to beneficiary agreement. While Faraid shares are mandatory in the sense that they're what s 112 AMLA requires absent any variation, beneficiaries can agree to redistribute. The Shiraz Husain case (children agreed to equal distribution) and the notes on male renunciation both show that Faraid's default can be overridden by beneficiary consensus. The MUIS Fatwa Committee has declared that renunciation and redistribution by heirs' agreement is 'allowed under Islamic law.' The mandatory nature of Faraid means testators cannot unilaterally override it (must follow 1/3 rule, can't disinherit), but beneficiaries who are entitled can choose to redistribute among themselves. This is voluntary renunciation by the entitled party, not forced modification. The answer incorrectly prohibits voluntary renunciation when Islamic law permits it.",

Male heirs can renounce their double shares and redistribute to female relatives - that's the whole point discussed in the notes ('share it with their female relatives'). If males could only renounce when there are no females, the renunciation would be pointless (who would they redistribute to?). The renunciation is meaningful precisely because there are female relatives who received smaller shares under default Faraid (daughters got half what sons got), and males can choose to equalize or adjust this. For example, if deceased left 2 sons and 2 daughters, default Faraid would give sons 2/5 each, daughters 1/5 each. Sons could renounce part of their shares to make distribution equal (1/4 each). This renunciation affects females (they receive more), which is the purpose. The answer incorrectly restricts renunciation to all-male scenarios when it's actually designed for mixed-gender situations.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the principle that males have greater responsibility is not a barrier to renunciation - it's actually the reason renunciation is permitted. The notes explain: 'with rights, comes responsibility... A male who chooses to accept the extra inheritance portion must realise that the rights, comes with added responsibility. This being the responsibility for the male member to provide for the female member's living and to secure their welfare.' The logic is: IF a male wants the double share, he should accept the responsibility to support female relatives. IF he doesn't want or can't handle that responsibility, he should renounce the extra share. The renunciation isn't violating the principle - it's acknowledging that the male doesn't want the extra responsibility that comes with extra rights, so he shouldn't take the extra share. The answer incorrectly treats the responsibility principle as prohibiting renunciation when it actually supports the permissibility of renunciation for those unwilling to accept the responsibility."

The notes explain: 'The testator can give only up to 1/3 of his estate in their will... Anything beyond 1/3 (to non-Faraid beneficiaries) requires the consent of the other living Faraid beneficiaries.' Here, the testator is giving to a permissible beneficiary (adopted son - non-Faraid) but giving too much ($250k > $200k limit). To give the $250k property, testator needs biological daughter's consent (she's the Faraid beneficiary who would normally get the other 2/3). With her consent, the testator could give the full $250k property. Without consent, only $200k can be willed to adopted son.

The comparison table lists 'Adopted children do not inherit automatically' and the notes state: 'In practice, the 1/3 is usually for: Adopted children, child out of wedlock, stepchildren/step-parent, non-Muslim family/friends, charity.' Adopted son is precisely the type of beneficiary testator can give to from the 1/3. The problem here is not the beneficiary (adopted son is permissible) but the quantum ($250k exceeds $200k limit).

The answer correctly identifies the problem (quantum exceeds 1/3) but doesn't complete the analysis about consent as a cure. A complete answer would note: invalid as drafted because exceeds 1/3, but could be valid if biological daughter (Faraid beneficiary) consents to the testator giving more than 1/3. The self-correction on math is good, but the analysis is incomplete regarding the consent pathway.",
          "C": "This answer contradicts itself. It says 'Yes' (valid) and then says 'daughter's consent cures this' (implying it's invalid without consent). If consent cures, the default position is invalid, not valid. The will as drafted, without daughter's consent documented, is invalid for exceeding 1/3. The answer should be 'No' with explanation that daughter's consent could cure the invalidity. The substance is partially right (adopted children are permissible non-Faraid beneficiaries, exceeding 1/3 requires consent) but the structure is confused. Additionally, the answer doesn't clarify that we're discussing consent being needed (not that it's already obtained).

As explained above, children conceived out of wedlock are 'not beneficiaries' at all, and adopted children 'do not inherit automatically.' Neither receives automatic shares via Faraid - both are excluded from the Faraid system. The answer incorrectly classifies both as Faraid beneficiaries when the comparison table explicitly indicates they're not. Under Muslim law (as applied in Singapore), legitimacy matters for Faraid - only legitimate children of the deceased are Faraid beneficiaries. Children born out of wedlock and adopted children do not have Faraid entitlement. The testator can provide for them using the 1/3 will portion, but they get nothing via automatic Faraid distribution. The answer invents a 'reduced share' concept that doesn't exist - it's not reduced shares, it's zero automatic shares."

      "question": "Muslim testator appoints his non-Muslim brother as executor in the will. Is this permissible under Muslim law and AMLA?",
      "options": {
        "A": "No - executor must be Muslim according to Muslim law requirements listed in notes.",
        "B": "Yes - per MUIS website, executor need NOT be Muslim; only need to fulfill legal requirements: 21 years old, sound mind, not undischarged bankrupt.",
        "C": "No - executor must be Faraid beneficiary, and non-Muslims cannot be Faraid beneficiaries.",
        "D": "Yes, but non-Muslim executor can only administer civil law assets, not Faraid distribution."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Yes, a non-Muslim can be executor. The notes discuss this: 'Under Muslim Law - Appointment of Executor and Trustee: Executor should be (1) Muslim; (2) Adult; (3) Sane; (4) Free of irreproachable character; and (5) Fit person to perform duties entrusted to him. (Note: so far, no challenge in Court on this). NB: NO NEED FOR EXECUTOR TO BE MUSLIM ACCORDING TO MUIS' WEBSITE! Only need to fulfil legal requirements to be executor: (1) 21 years old, (2) of sound mind and (3) not an undischarged bankrupt. An executor can also be a beneficiary under the will, as long as legal requirements are fulfilled. Normally, executors can be: family member, a friend, husband/wife, a professional executor, like a licensed trust company or lawyer.' The 'NO NEED FOR EXECUTOR TO BE MUSLIM' (capitalized in notes) is the current position per MUIS. While traditional Muslim law might require Muslim executors, the practical Singapore position (MUIS website, no court challenges) is that executors only need to meet general legal requirements, not religious requirements. This expands the pool of potential executors and allows testators to appoint trusted non-Muslim family members or professionals.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it relies on the traditional Muslim law requirements while ignoring the MUIS website clarification. The notes do list traditional requirements (executor should be Muslim, adult, sane, good character, fit), but immediately note: 'NO NEED FOR EXECUTOR TO BE MUSLIM ACCORDING TO MUIS' WEBSITE!' This suggests the traditional requirements are historical or idealized, but not the current practical position in Singapore. The MUIS website (the official source for Muslim community guidance) states executor need not be Muslim. Additionally, the notes observe: 'so far, no challenge in Court on this' - suggesting that while traditional Muslim law might require Muslim executors, no one has actually challenged a non-Muslim executor in Singapore courts, and MUIS's position is that religion is not required. The answer incorrectly applies traditional Muslim law requirements that Singapore's current practice (MUIS guidance, no court challenges) doesn't enforce.",
          "C": "This is incorrect on both points. First, executor need not be a Faraid beneficiary - executors can be anyone who meets the legal requirements (21 years old, sound mind, not bankrupt). The notes state 'An executor can also be a beneficiary under the will, as long as legal requirements are fulfilled' - 'can also be' suggests being a beneficiary is permitted but not required. Executors can be non-beneficiaries like friends, professional executors (trust companies, lawyers), or family members not entitled to inherit. Second, non-Muslims CAN be Faraid beneficiaries in one scenario: non-Muslim spouse married under Muslim law might be entitled (though this is complex). More importantly, the link between executor and beneficiary is wrong - executor's role is administering the estate, not receiving inheritance. Being a Faraid beneficiary is irrelevant to executor eligibility. The answer incorrectly creates a beneficiary requirement for executors that doesn't exist.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because it creates a divided administration that doesn't exist. An executor's role is to administer the entire estate - collecting assets, paying debts, obtaining grants, distributing to beneficiaries according to will/intestacy rules. There's no division where non-Muslim executors handle only certain assets. If a non-Muslim is validly appointed executor, they administer everything: obtaining Inheritance Certificate from SYC, applying for grant at FJC, collecting all assets (civil law and otherwise), distributing according to Faraid and will provisions. The executor doesn't personally decide Faraid distribution (the SYC Inheritance Certificate determines this), but they implement it by paying out the shares. Muslim law vs civil law assets is not a meaningful distinction - all assets are part of one estate administered by one executor. The answer incorrectly suggests segregated administration based on executor's religion when executors administer entire estates regardless of their religion."
