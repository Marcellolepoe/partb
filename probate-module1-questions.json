      "question": "Testator executed a will at age 19 while serving as a soldier in actual military service overseas. Two years later, at age 21, he was discharged and returned to civilian life. At age 25, he dies in a car accident. The will has never been revoked or altered. Which of the following statements is correct?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The will is invalid because the testator was below 21 years old when it was executed.",
        "B": "The will was valid when executed but became invalid when the testator was discharged from military service.",
        "C": "The will remains valid at the time of death despite the testator having been below 21 years old at execution.",
        "D": "The will must be re-executed after the testator turns 21 to remain valid."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will remains valid. Section 27(1) of the Wills Act provides an exception to the general rule in s 4 WA that testators must be at least 21 years old: 'any soldier being in actual military service, or any mariner or seaman being at sea, may dispose of his personal estate as he might have done before the making of this Act and may do so even though under the age of 21 years.' This privileged will-making power allows soldiers in actual military service to make valid wills while underage. Critically, once a valid will is made under this exception, it does NOT become invalid when the testator subsequently leaves military service or turns 21. The will's validity is assessed at the time of execution - if it was validly executed under s 27(1) while the testator was a soldier in actual military service, it remains valid unless subsequently revoked or altered. The testator's later discharge from service and return to civilian life does not retrospectively invalidate a will that was validly made. The will continues to operate until death unless revoked.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores the s 27(1) Wills Act exception for soldiers in actual military service. While s 4 WA sets the general requirement that testators must be at least 21 years old, s 27(1) creates a specific exception: soldiers in actual military service can make valid wills 'even though under the age of 21 years.' This is a privileged will-making capacity that has historical roots in military service. The testator was 19 years old AND serving as a soldier in actual military service when he executed the will - both conditions for the s 27(1) exception are satisfied. Therefore, the will was validly executed despite the testator being underage. The answer incorrectly applies the general s 4 rule without considering the s 27(1) exception.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because it misunderstands the effect of the s 27(1) exception. While s 27(1) allows soldiers in actual military service to make valid wills while underage, once such a will is validly executed, it does not become invalid when the privileged status ends (i.e., when the soldier is discharged). Validity is determined at the time of execution, not at the time of death. If the will was validly made under s 27(1) when the testator was in military service, it continues to be a valid will after discharge unless subsequently revoked under s 15 WA (by another will, writing declaring intention to revoke, or physical destruction with intention to revoke) or unless altered circumstances under s 13 WA (marriage) revoke it. Discharge from military service is not a circumstance that causes automatic revocation. Section 14 WA specifically provides that 'no will shall be revoked by any presumption of an intention on the ground of an alteration in circumstances.' The will remains valid throughout the testator's life unless affirmatively revoked.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no legal requirement for a will validly executed under s 27(1) to be re-executed once the testator turns 21 or leaves military service. A valid will remains valid until revoked or until the testator's death. Section 27(1) creates a valid will at the time of execution - it is not a provisional or conditional will that requires later confirmation. Once executed in compliance with s 27(1) (and any other applicable formalities), the will has full legal effect. Re-execution would only be necessary if: (1) the testator wanted to change the terms of the will, (2) the will was revoked (e.g., by marriage under s 13 WA unless expressed to be made in contemplation of that marriage), or (3) there were defects in the original execution that needed correcting. The mere fact that the testator has now turned 21 or left military service does not require re-execution. As a matter of estate planning, it might be prudent for the testator to review and potentially update the will made at age 19, but this is practical advice, not a legal requirement for validity."

      "question": "Testator, a 45-year-old man diagnosed with early-onset dementia, wishes to execute a new will. His solicitor meets with him once, reads the will to him, and has him sign it in the presence of two witnesses. Three years later, testator dies, and his daughter challenges the will arguing lack of testamentary capacity. Which of the following represents the solicitor's most significant failure in light of Chee Mu Lin Muriel?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The solicitor failed to have a doctor certify the testator's mental capacity before execution.",
        "B": "The solicitor failed to ask the testator appropriate questions to ascertain his capacity to understand the will's contents.",
        "C": "The solicitor failed to have at least three witnesses present at the execution.",
        "D": "The solicitor failed to ensure the will was registered at the Wills Registry."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The most significant failure is the solicitor's failure to ask appropriate questions to test the testator's understanding and capacity. In Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline [2010] 4 SLR 373, the Court of Appeal at [60] held that 'if a testator was known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she was allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator fully understood the will. Furthermore, the solicitor should ask the appropriate questions to ascertain the testator's capacity to understand the contents of the will.' The Court emphasized that 'the solicitor should ask as simple a question as whether he or she was making a will for the first time or whether he or she had made a will. In the latter case, the solicitor should ask whether the testator knew he was revoking the existing will. These questions might be formulaic, but they were necessary to avoid cases of the nature that we had decided.' The Court also stated that 'as a matter of good professional practice, if not professional prudence, the solicitor should make a contemporary written record of his or her attendances on the testator so that he or she would be able to recall exactly what had transpired during the meeting or meetings.' Simply reading the will to a testator suffering from mental infirmity is insufficient - the solicitor must actively test the testator's understanding through appropriate questions. The facts indicate the solicitor merely 'reads the will' without asking questions to test comprehension, which directly contravenes Chee Mu Lin Muriel's guidance.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "While Chee Mu Lin Muriel at [60] states that 'if a testator was known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she was allowed to sign the will,' this is recommended best practice rather than the most critical failure here. The Court noted this as part of a suite of precautions, but the judgment places equal if not greater emphasis on the solicitor's duty to 'ask the appropriate questions to ascertain the testator's capacity to understand the contents of the will.' Medical certification provides external evidence of capacity, but the solicitor's own assessment through questioning is equally important. Furthermore, the absence of medical certification alone might not be determinative - the court in Chee Mu Lin Muriel noted that 'under ordinary circumstances the reading of a will to a testator not suffering any mental infirmity would be sufficient evidence of his understanding or knowledge of the contents, but that general principle would not apply to a situation where the testator might not have full understanding due to the onset of dementia' (at [46]). The most critical failure is the solicitor's failure to actively test understanding through questions, which could have provided contemporaneous evidence of capacity regardless of whether a doctor was involved.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because there is no legal requirement for three witnesses. Section 6(2) Wills Act requires execution 'in the presence of 2 or more witnesses' - two witnesses are sufficient. Having three witnesses provides additional evidential support if one witness becomes incompetent or unavailable, but it is not required for validity. Section 9 WA actually contemplates that witnesses may become incompetent after execution: 'If any person who attested the execution of a will is, at the time of such execution or afterwards, incompetent to be admitted a witness to prove the execution thereof, the will shall not on that account be invalid.' So even if one of two witnesses later becomes incompetent, the will remains valid. The question states the will was signed 'in the presence of two witnesses,' which satisfies the s 6(2) requirement. This is not a failure at all, let alone the most significant one.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because registration at the Wills Registry is not a requirement for a will's validity. The Wills Registry is a voluntary registration system that helps locate wills after a testator's death, but non-registration does not invalidate a will. The practical steps outlined in the notes indicate that registration at the Wills Registry is part of 'post-execution' safekeeping measures, but it is not a formal validity requirement under the Wills Act. The formal requirements for validity under s 5-6 WA are: (1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator (or by someone at testator's direction in testator's presence), and (3) signature made or acknowledged in the presence of 2 or more witnesses present at the same time who subscribe the will in the testator's presence. Registration is not among these requirements. While it is good practice to register wills for practical reasons (locating the will after death), failure to register is not a 'significant failure' affecting the will's validity or the solicitor's duties regarding testamentary capacity."

      "question": "Husband and wife execute separate wills on the same day with identical terms, each leaving their entire estate to the other, and if the other predeceases, to their three children equally. They had an oral agreement that neither would revoke their will without the other's consent. Five years later, the husband dies. One year after that, the wife executes a new will leaving her entire estate to her eldest child only. Applying the principles from Hiroto, which of the following is correct?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The wills are mutual wills; the wife cannot validly revoke her will after the husband's death.",
        "B": "The wills are merely corresponding wills; the wife can freely revoke her will at any time.",
        "C": "The wife's new will is valid but gives rise to an action for breach of contract by the other two children.",
        "D": "The wife's new will is valid but a trust arises in favour of the three children, and revocation gives rise to breach of trust proceedings."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The wills are mutual wills, and while the wife can revoke her will, this gives rise to breach of trust proceedings. The notes explain the requirements for mutual wills from Hiroto: '(a) A prior agreement by the testators to make mutual wills, intending their agreement to become irrevocable upon the first person's death, and (b) The making of the mutual will.' Here, both requirements are satisfied: (1) there was an oral agreement not to revoke without the other's consent (the agreement can be oral per Hiroto at [15]), and (2) both parties executed wills pursuant to this agreement. The critical legal effect is stated in the notes: 'A contract is enforceable, but a will can always be revoked. The solution is that the will can always be revoked, but this gives rise to an action for breach of contract. Furthermore, on the first person's death, a trust arises in favour of the beneficiaries, and if the survivor revokes his will, this gives rise to proceedings for breach of trust.' (Hiroto at [8]). Once the husband died, a trust arose in favour of the three children (the beneficiaries under both mutual wills). The wife retains the power to revoke her will (wills are always revocable), but by doing so and changing the terms to benefit only the eldest child, she breaches the trust that arose in favour of all three children upon the husband's death. The two other children can bring breach of trust proceedings to enforce their rights under the trust.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect in stating that the wife 'cannot validly revoke' her will. The fundamental principle is that wills are always revocable - even mutual wills can be revoked. Section 15 WA sets out how wills may be revoked (by another will, by writing declaring intention to revoke, or by physical destruction), and there is no exception for mutual wills. The notes explicitly state: 'A contract is enforceable, but a will can always be revoked.' The legal solution to this tension is that while the wife can revoke her will (she has testamentary freedom), the revocation has legal consequences. As stated in the notes: 'the will can always be revoked, but this gives rise to an action for breach of contract. Furthermore, on the first person's death, a trust arises in favour of the beneficiaries, and if the survivor revokes his will, this gives rise to proceedings for breach of trust.' So the wife CAN validly revoke her will (the new will is effective as a testamentary document), but she faces breach of trust proceedings. The answer incorrectly suggests the revocation is invalid, when in fact it is valid but actionable.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because these are not merely 'corresponding wills' - they are mutual wills. The notes distinguish between the two: 'A common intention, expectation or desire (e.g. corresponding or mirror wills) will not suffice' for mutual wills (Hiroto at [15]). Corresponding or mirror wills are wills with identical or similar terms executed without an agreement that they are irrevocable. Here, there is more than just similar terms - there is 'an oral agreement that neither would revoke their will without the other's consent.' This prior agreement, combined with the execution of the wills pursuant to that agreement, satisfies the requirements for mutual wills. The notes confirm: 'The agreement can be oral or in writing, be incorporated in the will, or proved by extraneous evidence' (Hiroto at [15]). The oral agreement here is sufficient. Because these are mutual wills (not merely corresponding wills), the wife is NOT free to revoke without consequences. As noted above, upon the husband's death, a trust arose in favour of the three children, and revocation gives rise to breach of trust proceedings.",
          "C": "This is partially correct but incomplete. While it is true that the wife's new will is valid (wills can always be revoked) and that there is an action for breach of contract, this answer misses the more significant legal consequence: the trust that arises upon the first person's death. The notes from Hiroto at [8] explain: 'the will can always be revoked, but this gives rise to an action for breach of contract. Furthermore, on the first person's death, a trust arises in favour of the beneficiaries, and if the survivor revokes his will, this gives rise to proceedings for breach of trust.' There are thus TWO legal consequences: (1) breach of contract (the mutual wills agreement), and (2) breach of trust (the trust that arose in favour of the three children when the husband died). The breach of trust proceedings are actually more significant than the breach of contract claim because trusts are proprietary remedies (the beneficiaries have equitable interests in the property), whereas contract is generally limited to damages. By stating only breach of contract and omitting the trust, this answer fails to capture the full legal effect of mutual wills."

      "question": "Testator suffers from schizophrenia and has periodic delusions that his son is trying to poison him, though medical evidence shows the son has never harmed him. During a lucid period when the delusions have subsided, testator executes a will leaving nothing to his son and everything to his daughter. The son challenges the will for lack of testamentary capacity. Applying George Abraham and the test from Banks v Goodfellow, which element of testamentary capacity is most likely in issue?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Whether the testator understood the nature of the act and what its consequences were.",
        "B": "Whether the testator knew the extent of his property of which he was disposing.",
        "C": "Whether the testator was free from an abnormal state of mind that might distort feelings or judgments relevant to making the will.",
        "D": "Whether the testator knew who his beneficiaries were and could appreciate their claims to his property."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The fourth element of testamentary capacity is most likely in issue: whether the testator was free from an abnormal state of mind (delusions) that might distort feelings or judgments relevant to making the will. The test from Banks v Goodfellow as endorsed in George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George [2009] SGHC 79 at [29] requires that: (1) the testator understood the nature of the act and what its consequences were; (2) he knew the extent of his property of which he was disposing; (3) he knew who his beneficiaries were and could appreciate their claims to his property; and (4) he was free from an abnormal state of mind that might distort feelings of judgments relevant to making the will. The notes specifically describe the fourth element as requiring freedom from 'an abnormal state of mind (e.g., delusions) that might distort feelings or judgments relevant to making the will.' Here, the testator suffers from schizophrenia with periodic delusions that his son is trying to poison him. Even though the will was executed during a 'lucid period,' the critical question is whether the delusions influenced the testamentary disposition. The testator has disinherited his son entirely - this decision may have been influenced by the delusional belief that the son was trying to poison him, even if that specific delusion was not present at the exact moment of execution. The court will examine whether the abnormal state of mind (the delusional disorder) distorted the testator's feelings or judgment about his son's claim to the property.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "While this is the first element of testamentary capacity, it is unlikely to be the primary issue on these facts. 'Understanding the nature of the act and what its consequences were' means the testator must understand that he is making a will (a testamentary document to take effect on death) and that the will determines who gets his property after he dies. This is a relatively low threshold - even persons with significant mental impairments often understand these basic concepts. The facts indicate the testator 'executes a will' during a 'lucid period' when his delusions have subsided. There is no suggestion that he did not understand he was making a will or what a will does. The issue is not whether he understood the nature of will-making generally, but whether his mental disorder (schizophrenia with delusions) distorted his judgment about the specific disposition (disinheriting his son). The testator's decision to leave nothing to his son appears deliberate, not a product of not understanding what a will is.",
          "B": "This second element - knowing the extent of property being disposed of - is also unlikely to be the primary issue. This requirement means the testator must have a general understanding of his assets (property, bank accounts, investments, etc.) and approximately how much he owns. It does not require precise valuations or exhaustive knowledge of every asset, just a general sense of the estate. The facts do not suggest any confusion about the testator's assets or estate. The testator 'leaves nothing to his son and everything to his daughter' - this suggests he understands he has property to dispose of and is making a complete disposition of it. There is no indication that the schizophrenia or delusions affect his understanding of his property or its extent. The delusions are specifically about his son trying to poison him, not about confusion over what assets he owns.",
          "D": "This third element - knowing who the beneficiaries are and appreciating their claims to the property - is closer to the issue but still not the most direct. This element requires the testator to know who his potential beneficiaries are (family members, dependents) and to understand their moral or legal claims on his bounty. Here, the testator clearly knows who his son and daughter are (he is naming one and excluding the other), so the 'knowing who beneficiaries are' part is satisfied. The question is whether he can 'appreciate their claims' - specifically, whether he can appreciate his son's claim. However, the core issue is not whether the testator can appreciate claims in the abstract, but whether his appreciation is distorted by delusions. A testator is entitled to prefer one child over another for rational reasons or even arbitrary reasons, but not for reasons based on delusional beliefs. The heart of the challenge is that the delusion (son trying to poison him) may have distorted his judgment about the son's claim, which is more directly addressed by element (4) - freedom from abnormal state of mind distorting judgments."

      "question": "Testator executes a will in which he appoints his friend Peter as executor. The will is properly signed by the testator and witnessed by two people: (1) Peter's wife, and (2) a 19-year-old university student. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the validity of the will and Peter's appointment?",

        "A": "The will is invalid because Peter's wife is a witness and Peter benefits from the will as executor.",
        "B": "The will is invalid because the 19-year-old is below 21 years old and cannot be a competent witness.",
        "C": "The will is valid and Peter can act as executor, as executors can be witnesses and their spouses can witness the will.",
        "D": "The will is valid and Peter can act as executor, but if Peter were a beneficiary, his wife's witnessing would void his gift."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will is valid and Peter can act as executor. The key rules are: (1) executors CAN be witnesses (s 12 WA), (2) spouses of executors can also witness the will, and (3) the restriction on beneficiary-witnesses does not apply to executors. Section 10 Wills Act provides that 'the beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary CANNOT be witness(es) to the will' - but the notes clarify that s 12 WA provides 'Witness CAN be executor.' The policy distinction is that beneficiaries receive property under the will and therefore have an interest that might bias their testimony about its execution, whereas executors merely administer the estate without receiving beneficial gifts (unless they are also named as beneficiaries). Here, Peter is appointed as executor only - he is not receiving any gift or legacy under the will. Therefore, Peter could witness the will himself under s 12 WA. Since Peter can witness, his wife (who is not a beneficiary) can certainly witness without any problem. The 19-year-old witness issue is addressed by the notes: 'Witness CANNOT be a minor, must be at least 21 years old' - but section 9 WA provides that 'just because a witness is incompetent or becomes incompetent afterwards will NOT affect the validity of the will, as long as other requirements in s 6 WA are satisfied (e.g. 3 witnesses but 1 is a minor, then will is valid as there are 2 other competent witnesses remaining).' Here, there are two witnesses: Peter's wife (competent, as she's an adult and not a beneficiary) and the 19-year-old (incompetent as a minor). Since at least one competent witness exists (Peter's wife), and arguably two if we count the university student as the second person present (even if incompetent), the s 6(2) requirement is satisfied.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it misapplies the beneficiary-witness rule to executors. Section 10 Wills Act prohibits 'beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary' from being witnesses, but s 12 WA explicitly provides that 'Witness CAN be executor.' Executors are not 'beneficiaries' unless they also receive a gift under the will. The policy is that beneficiaries receive property and therefore have a financial interest that might bias their testimony, whereas executors merely perform administrative duties without receiving beneficial interests. The notes distinguish between: (1) s 10 WA - beneficiaries or their spouses cannot witness (would void their gift); (2) s 11 WA - creditors or their spouses CAN witness; and (3) s 12 WA - executors CAN witness. Since Peter is appointed as executor (not as a beneficiary receiving a gift), s 10 does not apply. His wife witnessing the will does not create any invalidity. Peter 'benefits' only in the sense that he has been given the responsibility (and potentially the executor's commission under s 66 PAA) to administer the estate, but this is not a 'benefit' that triggers s 10. The will is valid.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because the 19-year-old's incompetence as a witness does not invalidate the will if there is at least one other competent witness. The notes state: 'Witness CANNOT be a minor, must be at least 21 years old' - but crucially, s 9 WA provides a saving provision. The notes explain: 'just because a witness is incompetent or becomes incompetent afterwards will NOT affect the validity of the will, as long as other requirements in s 6 WA are satisfied (e.g. 3 witnesses but 1 is a minor, then will is valid as there are 2 other competent witnesses remaining).' Section 6(2) WA requires 'execution in the presence of 2 or more witnesses at the same time' who 'subscribe the will in the presence of the testator.' Here, there are two witnesses: Peter's wife (who is competent - she is an adult and not a beneficiary or spouse of a beneficiary, since Peter is an executor not a beneficiary) and the 19-year-old (who is incompetent as a minor). Since Peter's wife is a competent witness and the requirements of s 6 are otherwise satisfied (testator signed, witnesses subscribed in testator's presence), the will is valid despite the 19-year-old's incompetence. The answer incorrectly assumes that any incompetent witness invalidates the entire will.",
          "D": "This answer is correct in its ultimate conclusion but includes unnecessary and potentially confusing hypothetical language about 'if Peter were a beneficiary.' The question asks which statement is correct regarding the validity of the will and Peter's appointment as executor based on the facts given - not about a hypothetical where Peter is a beneficiary. While it is true that if Peter were a beneficiary (in addition to being executor), then his wife witnessing the will would cause Peter's gift to be void under s 10 WA ('beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary CANNOT be witness(es) to the will'), this is not the situation presented. Peter is only an executor, not a beneficiary. Including the hypothetical 'if Peter were a beneficiary' makes this answer less direct and clear than option C, which straightforwardly addresses the actual facts: the will is valid and Peter can act as executor because executors can be witnesses and their spouses can witness the will. While option D is not legally incorrect, option C is the better answer because it directly addresses the facts without introducing hypotheticals."

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will is valid up to the testator's signature, but the clause added after the signature has no effect. Section 5(4) Wills Act provides: 'no signature under this Act shall be operative to give effect to any disposition or direction which is underneath or which follows it, nor shall it give effect to any disposition or direction inserted after the signature shall be made.' The testator validly executed the will with his signature in the blank space on page 5, followed by the attestation clause where witnesses signed - this satisfies the formalities under s 6 WA. Section 5(3) WA confirms that a signature is validly placed if 'it shall be apparent on the face of the will that the testator intended to give effect by such his signature to the writing signed as his will.' The testator's signature in the blank space before the attestation clause satisfies this requirement. However, when the testator subsequently added a clause 'between his signature and the attestation clause,' this new clause follows the testator's signature. Under s 5(4), anything that 'follows' the signature or is 'inserted after the signature shall be made' has no effect. The clause giving the car to the nephew, added three months after execution, follows the signature and therefore cannot take effect. This rule prevents testators from making informal additions after execution without complying with proper formalities (either executing a new will under s 6 or a codicil, or complying with s 16 regarding alterations).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because the testator's signature placement is valid under s 5(3) Wills Act. Section 6(2) requires the testator to 'sign at the foot or end of the will,' but s 5(3) provides flexibility in signature placement: the signature is 'deemed valid if the signature shall be so placed at or after, or following, or under, or beside, or opposite to the end of the will, that it shall be apparent on the face of the will that the testator intended to give effect by such his signature to the writing signed as his will.' Here, the testator signed 'after all the dispositive clauses but before the attestation clause' - this is a common and proper location for the testator's signature in wills. The dispositive clauses constitute the substantive content of the will, and signing after them (even if before the attestation clause) clearly indicates the testator's intention to give effect to those clauses. The attestation clause is a formal clause describing the execution ceremony; signing before it does not invalidate the will. The signature is 'at or after' the end of the substantive dispositions, satisfying s 5(3). The problem is not the location of the original signature, but the subsequent addition below it.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because additions made after the will is signed, and placed after the signature, have no effect under s 5(4) Wills Act even if made before the testator's death. The notes state that s 5(4) provides: 'no signature under this Act shall be operative to give effect to any disposition or direction which is underneath or which follows it, nor shall it give effect to any disposition or direction inserted after the signature shall be made.' There are two problems with the car clause: (1) it is physically located after/below the testator's signature ('in the space between his signature and the attestation clause'), and (2) it was 'inserted after the signature shall be made' (added three months after execution). Both grounds under s 5(4) mean the clause has no effect. The phrase 'before the will took effect' is also legally imprecise - wills 'take effect' at death due to their ambulatory nature (s 19 WA), but the formal execution occurs when the will is signed and witnessed. The issue is not when the will takes effect (at death), but whether the addition complies with execution formalities. It does not, so it is ineffective.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because signing next to the new clause does not cure the invalidity under s 5(4) Wills Act. Section 16 WA governs alterations to wills after execution: 'obliteration, interlineation or other alteration made in any will after the execution thereof shall only have effect if signed by testator and witnesses (except insofar as the will becomes incomprehensible).' So if the testator and witnesses signed next to the new clause, this might validate it as an alteration under s 16. However, the facts state that 'testator writes an additional clause' three months after execution, with no indication that he or the witnesses signed next to it. Without such signatures, the alteration has no effect under s 16. Furthermore, even with signatures next to the clause, there's a more fundamental problem: s 5(4) states that nothing 'which follows' the signature or 'inserted after the signature shall be made' has effect. The new clause physically follows the original signature. While s 16 might validate additions that are interlineations (insertions within the text above the signature) if properly signed, additions that come after the testator's signature present a s 5(4) problem. The better course would be to execute a codicil or new will to add the car bequest."

Client's daughter, who is also the solicitor's former law school classmate, accompanies Client to all meetings and is very involved in the process.

In light of Low Ah Cheow and professional conduct standards, which of the following represents the solicitor's greatest failure?",

        "A": "The solicitor failed to refuse to act due to a conflict of interest between the client and the daughter.",

        "C": "The solicitor failed to document thoroughly his discussions with Client and the circumstances of the daughter's involvement.",
        "D": "The solicitor failed to advise Client to register the will at the Wills Registry."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The greatest failure is the lack of thorough documentation of discussions and instructions, especially given the suspicious circumstances. In Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR (R) 1079, the Court held at [38] that attendance notes are critical: 'necessary to compare the testimony of the solicitor who drafted the will with his attendance notes since those notes are (or at least should be) a contemporaneous record of the testator's instructions. This omission could persuade the court to doubt the veracity of the drafting solicitor's testimony if a dispute arises as to the purport of the terms of the will; the court may even draw adverse inferences against the drafting solicitor.' The Court at [72] emphasized: 'There should be no room for even the slightest doubt or the slightest possibility of mistake on a solicitor's part, in both understanding the testator's intention and expressing that intention in the will.' At [73]: 'The solicitor should thoroughly discuss all possible legal issues and potential complications, and painstakingly and accurately document his discussions and instructions.' Crucially, at [74]: 'The solicitor should also conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation where a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist. The solicitor must be nothing less than a completely independent adviser. Exceptional restraint and care are called for, if the solicitor has a pre-existing relationship or past dealings with the beneficiary, especially if the will is prepared urgently and executed under unusual circumstances with that sole beneficiary's active involvement.' Here, the daughter (the main beneficiary) has a pre-existing relationship with the solicitor (law school classmates) and is actively involved ('accompanies Client to all meetings and is very involved'). This creates suspicious circumstances per Chee Mu Lin Muriel at [48]. The solicitor's failure to painstakingly document these circumstances, the daughter's level of involvement, and Client's independent instructions is the most critical failure.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "While there are concerning circumstances suggesting a potential conflict of interest or suspicious circumstances, it is not necessarily the case that the solicitor must refuse to act. Low Ah Cheow at [74] states that 'the solicitor should also conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation where a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist' and that 'exceptional restraint and care are called for, if the solicitor has a pre-existing relationship or past dealings with the beneficiary.' However, this does not mean the solicitor MUST refuse to act - rather, the solicitor must exercise 'exceptional restraint and care.' The key is to ensure that the Client is acting independently and that the solicitor is advising the Client (not the daughter). This can be achieved through: (1) meeting with Client alone without the daughter present for at least some discussions, (2) carefully documenting Client's independent instructions and understanding, (3) ensuring Client knows and approves of the will's contents, and (4) being alert to any signs of undue influence. The rule is not an absolute prohibition on acting, but a requirement for heightened vigilance and documentation. The failure here is not necessarily in agreeing to act, but in failing to document properly the steps taken to ensure Client's independent decision-making.",
          "B": "There is no indication in the facts that the will was not executed with proper formalities. The question states that the will was executed and Client died six months later, with the son challenging the will. The challenge is not based on lack of formalities (which would be an issue of formal validity under ss 5-6 Wills Act), but implicitly based on suspicious circumstances, possible undue influence, or lack of knowledge and approval (given the daughter's involvement). Low Ah Cheow does note in the context of professional negligence that solicitors must ensure due execution, but there is no suggestion in these facts that formalities were not followed. The solicitor's failure relates to the process of taking instructions and documenting the circumstances, not to the execution ceremony itself. The notes from Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC v AEL [2015] 4 SLR 325 confirm that solicitors must ensure due execution (in that case, the solicitor was negligent for having only one witness), but here there is no indication of such a failure.",
          "D": "Registration at the Wills Registry is a post-execution safekeeping measure and is not a requirement for validity. The notes confirm: 'Practical pointers after execution: (i) Safekeeping of wills and (ii) Wills Registry.' Registration helps locate wills after death but is not a formal requirement and is not among the solicitor's critical duties identified in Low Ah Cheow. While it is good practice to advise clients about registration for practical reasons, failure to do so is not the type of professional failing that Low Ah Cheow addresses. Low Ah Cheow focuses on: (1) thoroughly understanding and documenting the testator's instructions, (2) accurately expressing those instructions in the will, (3) avoiding conflicts of interest, and (4) ensuring the solicitor is an independent adviser. These substantive duties relating to instructions and independence are far more critical than the administrative step of registering the will. Given the suspicious circumstances here (daughter's involvement, pre-existing relationship), the failure to document thoroughly is the most serious professional failure."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will is valid but subject to the two-thirds rule in Muslim law. In Mohamed Ismail Bin Ibrahim v Mohd Taha Bin Ibrahim [2004] 4 SLR(R) 756, the Court held that 'a principal restriction in Muslim law, as had been declared in all the authoritative works and treatises, and referred to in s 114 of the AMLA, was that a testator was not entitled to dispose of more than one-third of the property belonging to him at the time of death, and that the residue of his property must descend in fixed proportions to his legal heirs unless consent was given by all legal heirs to any deviation from the rule.' The notes from the PCP-Probate materials explain: 'the two-thirds rule where 2/3 of T's assets must be reserved for his beneficiaries under Faraid, so he is only free to dispose of the remaining 1/3 freely.' This means that while the testator can execute a valid will (the will itself is not void), his testamentary freedom is limited to one-third of his estate. The remaining two-thirds must be distributed according to Faraid (Muslim intestacy rules) to his prescribed heirs (wife and children). So the friend will receive one-third of the estate (as per the will), and the wife and three children will receive two-thirds distributed according to Faraid proportions. The will is not 'invalid' - rather, it is effective to the extent of one-third, with the two-thirds passing by operation of Muslim law.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because the will is not entirely invalid - it is valid but limited in its effect. The two-thirds rule in Muslim law does not void wills that attempt to dispose of more than one-third; rather, it limits the effective disposition to one-third and requires the remainder to pass by Faraid. The notes from Mohamed Ismail Bin Ibrahim explain that the testator is 'not entitled to dispose of more than one-third' and that 'the residue of his property must descend in fixed proportions to his legal heirs.' This is a rule about the extent of testamentary power, not about the validity of the will itself. A Muslim testator can execute a formally valid will under the Wills Act that purports to dispose of his entire estate, but the legal effect is that only one-third passes according to the will's terms, with two-thirds passing by Faraid. The distinction is important: an invalid will has no effect at all, but here the will has effect as to one-third. The court would likely uphold the will to the extent of one-third and order the two-thirds to be distributed under Faraid.",
          "C": "While it is true that the two-thirds rule can be overridden 'unless consent was given by all legal heirs to any deviation from the rule' (Mohamed Ismail Bin Ibrahim), this answer incorrectly suggests that consent is required for the will to be valid at all. The will is valid even without consent - it just operates subject to the two-thirds rule. With consent of all Faraid beneficiaries, the testator could give more than one-third (potentially even the entire estate) to the friend, but this consent must be obtained. The facts do not indicate that the wife and children have consented - they are challenging the will. Without consent, the default rule applies: one-third to the friend per the will, two-thirds distributed via Faraid. The answer is incorrect in making validity conditional on consent, when the reality is that the will is valid but limited in effect unless consent is obtained. Additionally, consent would typically be obtained during the testator's lifetime or after death before distribution, not as a prerequisite for the will's formal validity.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because Muslim law restrictions do apply to Muslims domiciled in Singapore, even if Wills Act formalities are satisfied. There is a distinction between formal validity (compliance with Wills Act requirements for execution) and substantive effect (the extent of testamentary power). The notes state: 'A will is only valid when it complies with both FORMAL and SUBSTANTIVE requirements of making a will.' For Muslims, the substantive requirements include the two-thirds rule from Muslim law. Section 111 AMLA (referenced in the notes) restricts the testamentary power of Muslims domiciled in Singapore. Merely complying with Wills Act formalities (signing, witnesses, etc.) satisfies the formal requirements, but does not override the substantive limits imposed by Muslim law on how much a Muslim testator can give away by will. The Wills Act governs the form and execution of wills, but does not displace the substantive rules of Muslim law that limit testamentary freedom for Muslims domiciled in Singapore. Therefore, even with perfect Wills Act compliance, the will's effect is limited to one-third."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The son and daughter can apply for probate after the lawyer and accountant formally renounce their positions. Section 6(1) Probate and Administration Act provides that 'probate can only be granted to a maximum of 4 persons' but does not require all appointed executors to take up the grant. The notes explain: 'Any adult, including beneficiaries of a will CAN be an executor - while any number can be named, probate can only be granted to a maximum of 4 persons (s 6 PAA).' When some appointed executors do not wish to act, they must formally renounce under the Probate and Administration Act. The notes state: 'How to renounce: (a) orally at hearing of probate application or (2) in writing in Form 53(a) attested by solicitor (s 3(2) PAA).' Further: 'Effect of Renunciation of probate: (1) precludes person from applying for grant, (2) but court can allow person to withdraw renunciation for benefit of estate or interested persons (s 5 PAA).' So the lawyer and accountant must file renunciations (Form 53) before the son and daughter can apply. The renunciation clears the way for the remaining executors to act. Once renunciations are filed, the son and daughter can apply for probate as the only acting executors. They do not need permission from those who renounced - the renunciation itself eliminates the non-acting executors from the grant process.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because not all appointed executors are required to take up the grant, and failure of some executors to act does not invalidate the will. The notes state: 'If there is no executor who can or does appear and extract probate, letters of administration with the will annexed may be granted' under s 13(1) PAA - but this applies when NO executors can or will act. Here, two of the four executors (son and daughter) wish to act, so there is no need for letters of administration with will annexed. The will remains perfectly valid even if some appointed executors choose not to act. The Probate and Administration Act contemplates that appointed executors may not take up the grant - they can renounce under s 3 PAA. The son and daughter simply need to obtain renunciations from the lawyer and accountant, then apply for probate themselves. There is no requirement that all appointed executors must act together, nor does failure of some to act challenge the will's validity. The will's validity depends on compliance with Wills Act formalities (execution, witnesses, etc.), not on whether all appointed executors actually take up the grant.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the son and daughter cannot simply apply alone without addressing the lawyer and accountant's positions. The court will require clarity on whether all appointed executors are taking up the grant. If some are not, they must formally renounce their appointments. The notes specify the procedure: renunciation can be done 'orally at hearing of probate application or in writing in Form 53(a) attested by solicitor.' Without renunciations from the lawyer and accountant, the court might question whether all executors have been notified and given the opportunity to act. The renunciation process ensures that: (1) all appointed executors are aware of the testator's death and the grant application, (2) those not wishing to act formally disclaim their positions, and (3) there is a clear record of who is and is not acting as executor. Simply proceeding without the lawyer and accountant's renunciations could cause administrative problems and delay the grant. While the practical effect may be similar (son and daughter acting as executors), the proper procedure requires obtaining renunciations first.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no requirement in s 6 PAA for a minimum of three executors when four are appointed. Section 6(1) PAA sets only a maximum: 'probate can only be granted to a maximum of 4 persons.' There is no minimum number of executors required to take up the grant, except in specific circumstances set out in s 6(2) PAA: 'if there is a minor (below 21) who is a beneficiary or a life interest under the deceased's estate, need at least 2 administrators for the estate.' But this is for administrators in letters of administration cases, not for executors in probate. For executors, even a single executor can take up the grant and act alone. The notes confirm: 'Only one (1) executor is required' (in the comparison table between testate and intestate administration). So if three of the four appointed executors renounced, the remaining one could act alone. Here, two wish to act (son and daughter), which is more than sufficient. The answer invents a non-existent rule requiring three executors."

        "correct": "The gift raises a significant conflict of interest issue under Rule 25 PCR 2015. The notes state: 'Rule 25 Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 - significant gift to immediate family member of partner, director, consultant or employee of law practice.' Rule 25 PCR provides: '(1) A legal practitioner must not act for a client in relation to any gift by the client if the legal practitioner knows or ought reasonably to know that the gift is, or is likely to be, a significant gift to any of the following persons: ... (c) an immediate family member of any partner, director, consultant or employee of the law practice of which the legal practitioner is a partner, director, consultant or employee.' While the rule does not automatically void the gift (that would be a matter of substantive law), it establishes professional conduct standards that the solicitor must follow. The solicitor should have: (1) recognized the conflict (nephew is partner in the same firm), (2) not acted for the testator in relation to this gift, and (3) advised the testator to obtain independent legal advice under r 25(2)(b): 'the legal practitioner ... must advise the client to obtain independent legal advice in relation to the gift.' The case of Law Society of Singapore v Lee Suet Fern [2020] SGDT 1 (referenced in the notes) involved similar issues where there was 'clear conflict of interest regardless of whether LKY's last will increased, decreased or maintained LHY's share who was the husband of the solicitor.' The failure to address this conflict is a professional conduct breach that creates grounds to challenge the gift.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This answer overstates the legal effect by declaring the gift 'void.' Rule 25 PCR 2015 is a professional conduct rule governing solicitors' behavior, not a rule of substantive law that automatically voids gifts. The notes show Rule 25 in the context of 'Risk of conflict of interest' and professional duties, not as a rule voiding gifts. Whether a gift is void would depend on substantive law principles such as undue influence, lack of knowledge and approval, or breach of fiduciary duty. Rule 25 creates professional conduct obligations on solicitors (don't act for client in relation to the gift, advise client to get independent advice), but breach of these obligations does not automatically void the gift. However, breach of Rule 25 would be strong evidence of suspicious circumstances and could support a challenge to the gift on substantive grounds. The gift is challengeable and the solicitor has breached professional conduct rules, but the gift is not automatically 'void' merely because of the Rule 25 violation. The proper analysis is option D - this raises a significant conflict that should have been addressed.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because Rule 25 PCR 2015 applies when the gift is to 'an immediate family member of any partner, director, consultant or employee of the law practice' - it does not require that the partner who is the beneficiary's relative personally drafted the will. The rule applies to the 'law practice' as a whole, not just to the individual solicitor. The notes reference Rule 25 which covers 'significant gift to immediate family member of partner, director, consultant or employee of law practice' (emphasis added). The nephew is described as 'a partner in the same law firm' as the drafting solicitor. Even though the nephew 'did not work on the will,' Rule 25 applies because he is a partner in the law practice, and the gift is significant ($500,000). The policy is to avoid conflicts of interest across the entire law practice, not just for the individual solicitor handling the matter. The law practice as an entity should have systems to identify such conflicts. The fact that the nephew did not personally work on the file does not eliminate the conflict.",
          "C": "This answer is partially correct but incomplete. Rule 25(2) PCR does provide that when a gift is to be made to a person within the prohibited categories, the legal practitioner '(a) must not act for the client in relation to the gift; and (b) must advise the client to obtain independent legal advice in relation to the gift.' So obtaining independent legal advice is part of the solution, but it is not sufficient on its own - the solicitor also must NOT ACT for the client in relation to the gift. The notes emphasize: 'Get informed consent from clients, advise to seek independent legal advice, remain aware of conflict of interests, protect each client's interests.' Here, the solicitor drafted the will including the gift to the nephew (partner in the same firm). This is 'acting for the client in relation to the gift,' which Rule 25(2)(a) prohibits. The proper course would be for the solicitor to: (1) identify the conflict, (2) advise the testator about the conflict, (3) not draft the clause relating to the nephew's gift, and (4) advise the testator to obtain independent legal advice about that gift (either from another firm or from an independent solicitor). Simply obtaining independent advice while the solicitor still acts is not sufficient - the solicitor must not act in relation to the gift."

        "correct": "The will is valid and the debt remains enforceable. Section 11 Wills Act explicitly permits creditors and their spouses to witness wills: 'Witness CAN be creditor or creditor's spouse (s 11 WA).' This is in contrast to s 10 WA which prohibits beneficiaries and their spouses from witnessing. The policy distinction is clear: a beneficiary receives property under the will and therefore has an interest that might bias testimony about execution. A creditor, conversely, is owed money by the testator - the creditor does not receive a gift under the will, but rather has a pre-existing debt claim against the estate. The creditor's interest is to ensure the will is valid so the estate can be properly administered and the debt paid from estate assets. This interest does not create the same bias concerns as a beneficiary-witness. The notes explicitly list the witness rules: '(1) Beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary CANNOT be witness(es) to the will (s 10 WA), (2) Witness CAN be creditor or creditor's spouse (s 11 WA), (3) Witness CAN be executor (s 12 WA).' Here, both witnesses are permissible under s 11 WA. The debt is not affected by the witnessing - it remains a valid debt claim against the estate to be paid in due course of administration.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because having a financial interest in the estate does not disqualify a creditor from being a witness. While creditors do have a financial interest (they are owed money), this is a different type of interest than a beneficiary's interest. Section 11 WA specifically permits creditors and their spouses to witness wills. The policy rationale is that creditors want the estate to be properly administered so they can be paid, which aligns with proper execution and administration rather than creating bias against validity. In contrast, beneficiaries receive gifts under the will and might benefit from false testimony about execution. Section 10 WA prohibits beneficiary-witnesses because of this direct conflict, but s 11 permits creditor-witnesses. The fact that both witnesses here are the creditor and his wife does not invalidate the will - both are permissible witnesses under s 11. The will is validly executed if it otherwise complies with s 6 WA requirements (testator signed, witnesses present at same time, witnesses subscribed in testator's presence).",
          "B": "This is incorrect because there is no rule that witnessing a will by a creditor forgives or extinguishes the debt. Section 11 WA permits creditors to witness wills, but it does not address the status of the debt itself. The debt remains a valid claim against the estate. When a person dies, their debts do not disappear - they become claims against the estate to be paid during administration. The notes explain that personal representatives have a 'Responsibility of executors (in probate) and administrators (in LA or LA with will annexed)' which includes paying debts. The Schedule of Assets filed with probate applications includes debts and liabilities. The fact that the creditor witnessed the will does not release the debt - it simply confirms that creditors are permissible witnesses. If anything, the creditor witnessing the will might help ensure the will's validity so the estate can be properly administered and the debt paid. The answer conflates the witnessing role (which is about attesting to proper execution) with the debt relationship (which is a separate legal obligation of the estate).",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no requirement for three witnesses or for independent witnesses when creditors witness a will. Section 6(2) Wills Act requires 'execution in the presence of 2 or more witnesses' - two witnesses are sufficient. The notes confirm this: 'Executed in the presence of 2 or more witnesses at the same time and those witnesses shall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator (s 6(2) WA).' There is no requirement that the witnesses be 'independent' in the sense of having no connection to the testator. Witnesses can be creditors (s 11 WA), executors (s 12 WA), or even family members who are not beneficiaries. The key restrictions are: (1) witnesses must be at least 21 years old (competent adults), (2) beneficiaries or spouses of beneficiaries cannot witness (s 10 WA), and (3) witnesses must be present at the same time and subscribe in the testator's presence. Here, the creditor and his wife are both competent adults, both are permitted to witness under s 11 WA, and if they were present at the same time and subscribed in the testator's presence, the will is valid. No third witness or 'independent' witness is required."

      "question": "Testator, a 70-year-old widow, executes a will leaving her entire estate to her nephew. The will was drafted by the nephew's law firm (though not by the nephew personally), and was prepared urgently over a weekend when the testator was in hospital. The testator died two weeks later. The testator's children challenge the will. Applying Chee Mu Lin Muriel, which of the following circumstances would raise 'well-grounded suspicion' requiring the propounder to prove knowledge and approval?",

        "C": "The fact that the testator died only two weeks after executing the will.",
        "D": "The fact that the will leaves everything to the nephew rather than being divided among all relatives."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The preparation of the will by a law firm associated with the main beneficiary, combined with urgent and unusual execution circumstances, raises well-grounded suspicion. In Chee Mu Lin Muriel at [46], the Court held: 'Once testamentary capacity has been established, a rebuttable [evidential] presumption arises that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will at the time of execution,' UNLESS 'there were circumstances surrounding the execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will (or some provision in it) did not express the mind of the testator.' At [48], the Court gave examples of suspicious circumstances: 'where a will was prepared by a person who takes a substantial benefit under it, or who has procured its execution, such as by suggesting the terms to the testator or instructing a solicitor to draft the will which is then executed by the testator alone.' Here, the will was 'drafted by the nephew's law firm' (even though not by the nephew personally) and the nephew takes a substantial benefit (the entire estate). This alone raises suspicion. Additionally, the will was 'prepared urgently over a weekend when the testator was in hospital' - these unusual circumstances (urgency, hospital setting, weekend preparation) compound the suspicion. As Low Ah Cheow at [74] notes, 'exceptional restraint and care are called for, if the solicitor has a pre-existing relationship or past dealings with the beneficiary, especially if the will is prepared urgently and executed under unusual circumstances with that sole beneficiary's active involvement.' The combination of these factors raises well-grounded suspicion requiring the propounder to affirmatively prove the testator knew and approved of the will's contents.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Age alone does not raise suspicious circumstances requiring proof of knowledge and approval. While advanced age might be relevant to testamentary capacity (especially if combined with evidence of mental decline), being 70 years old is not itself a 'well-grounded suspicion' about knowledge and approval. The notes explain that 'proving that the terms of the will were read to or explained to the testator is the best way to show that the testator understood the terms of the will (assuming he had testamentary capacity and his mind was not unduly influenced by some part or event)' (Lian Kok Hong at [72]). Many testators execute wills in their 70s, 80s, or even 90s with full testamentary capacity and knowledge of their wills' contents. Age becomes relevant when combined with other factors like mental infirmity, but the facts do not indicate the testator had dementia or other mental issues. The suspicious circumstances doctrine focuses on the circumstances of execution (who prepared the will, who benefits, unusual circumstances) rather than on the testator's age per se. If the testator were in her 90s with documented dementia, that might raise capacity issues, but 70 years old alone does not raise knowledge and approval suspicions.",
          "C": "The short interval between execution and death does not itself raise suspicious circumstances. The notes from Chee Mu Lin Muriel at [46] state that 'all forms of suspicious circumstances ought to be considered,' whether 'contemporaneous events' or 'events subsequent to the execution of the will' - but these must 'have a direct bearing on whether the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will' (Lian Kok Hong). Death two weeks after execution might be relevant context (suggesting the testator was seriously ill, which combined with urgent preparation might raise questions), but it does not directly bear on whether the testator understood the will when signing it. Many people execute wills shortly before death, especially when facing terminal illness - this is sensible estate planning. The timing of death is not itself suspicious unless it suggests incapacity at execution or undue influence. The suspicious circumstances here are the involvement of the beneficiary's law firm and the urgent/unusual circumstances of preparation and execution, not the subsequent death.",
          "D": "While leaving everything to one relative (nephew) and nothing to closer relatives (children) might seem unusual, this alone does not raise legally cognizable suspicious circumstances. The notes from UWF v UWH at [237] confirm: 'A parent is entitled to have favourite child(ren) and least-favoured child(ren), in accordance to his or her subjective preferences' and can decide 'to bequeath nothing to one or all of the children' - this will not be suspicious to prevent the rebuttable presumption of testamentary capacity from being established. Testators have testamentary freedom to dispose of their property as they wish, even if the disposition seems unfair or irrational to others. The law respects testators' autonomy to prefer one family member over others, or even to leave everything to non-family members. What raises suspicion is not the terms of the will per se, but the circumstances of its preparation and execution. Here, the suspicious circumstances are: (1) the will was prepared by the beneficiary's law firm, and (2) it was executed urgently in unusual circumstances (hospital, weekend). These procedural/relational factors, not the substantive terms, create the suspicion."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The will is valid if it complies with the formalities in s 6 Wills Act, regardless of being handwritten. Section 6(1) Wills Act requires that a will be 'in writing' but does not specify that it must be typed, printed, or professionally drafted. The notes state: 'Will must be in writing (s 6 WA).' 'In writing' includes handwritten wills (sometimes called 'holographic wills' in other jurisdictions, though Singapore does not use special rules for holographic wills). The key requirements are: (1) the will must be in writing (handwritten satisfies this), (2) the testator must sign at the foot or end (s 6(2)), and (3) the signature must be made or acknowledged in the presence of 2 or more witnesses present at the same time who subscribe the will in the testator's presence (s 6(2)). A handwritten will that satisfies these formalities is just as valid as a typed or professionally drafted will. Indeed, handwritten wills may have evidentiary advantages - the handwriting can help prove that the testator wrote the will personally (evidence of knowledge and approval), and handwriting analysis can verify authenticity. However, handwritten wills also carry risks: they may be ambiguous, use imprecise language, fail to dispose of all property (partial intestacy), or not account for legal complexities. But these are practical concerns, not grounds for invalidity if the s 6 formalities are satisfied.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because there is no requirement that wills be professionally drafted by solicitors. While it is prudent and advisable to engage a solicitor to draft a will (to ensure proper expression of intentions, consideration of tax implications, avoidance of ambiguity, etc.), testators are free to draft their own wills. The notes emphasize solicitor duties when solicitors do draft wills (thoroughness, documentation, avoiding conflicts), but this is guidance for solicitors, not a requirement that all wills be solicitor-drafted. The Wills Act sets out formal requirements (writing, signature, witnesses) but does not mandate professional drafting. Indeed, the very existence of s 28 WA (rectification of clerical errors or failure to understand instructions) contemplates that wills might be drafted by non-professionals and contain errors. 'Homemade' wills are valid if they comply with s 6 formalities. The notes reference 'If the will was homemade and/or not signed or witnessed properly, the Court may require an Affidavit of Due Execution of the Will to be filed' - this shows homemade wills are recognized, though they may require additional proof of proper execution.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because s 6(1) Wills Act requires only that the will be 'in writing' without specifying the medium. Handwritten wills satisfy the 'in writing' requirement. The statute does not distinguish between handwritten, typed, or printed wills - all are 'in writing.' The policy of the Wills Act is to require formalities (writing, signature, witnesses) to provide evidence of testamentary intention and to prevent fraud, but the statute does not mandate any particular method of writing. Historically, most wills were handwritten before typewriters and computers became common. Modern technology has made typed wills more prevalent, but this is a practical choice, not a legal requirement. A handwritten will on paper is 'in writing' just as much as a typed will. The critical issue is whether the formalities in s 6(2) are satisfied (testator's signature, witnesses' signatures, proper execution ceremony), not the method used to create the writing.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no requirement for handwriting verification by an expert as a condition of validity. If a will is properly executed with the testator's signature and witnesses, it is presumptively valid. Handwriting verification might become relevant if there is a challenge to the will's authenticity (e.g., alleging the will is a forgery or that the handwriting is not the testator's). In such cases, the notes reference 'Fraud or Forgery' as an issue in contentious probate actions, where 'Handwriting evidence is not the only evidence (Nina Kung, [12])' but can be used. However, this is a matter of proof in a challenge, not a prerequisite for validity. A properly executed handwritten will is valid without expert verification. The witnesses who watched the testator sign provide evidence of authenticity. If no challenge is raised, or if a challenge is raised but fails, the will is valid based on compliance with s 6 formalities. Expert verification is an evidentiary tool in disputes, not a formal validity requirement."

The notes state: 'If Registrar wants to satisfy himself as to: (1) execution of will by blind/illiterate testator... he can require affidavit from any person (FJR r 215).' Blind persons can execute valid wills - blindness does not affect legal capacity or testamentary capacity. However, because the testator cannot see the will's text, courts require evidence that the will's contents were properly communicated to the testator and that the testator understood and approved the contents. The notes indicate variations in attestation clauses 'where testator is unable to sign, or cannot understand English, or signs with a non-English language, or is blind.' While a special attestation clause is recommended for blind testators (stating that the will was read to the testator and the testator appeared to understand it), failure to use such a clause does not invalidate the will. Instead, the Registrar can require an affidavit under FJR r 215 to establish proper execution. The affidavit would come from the solicitor or witnesses, explaining that the will was read to the blind testator, the testator understood it, and the testator signed it (or directed someone to sign for him if unable to sign personally). This additional evidence satisfies the court that the blind testator knew and approved of the will's contents.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because blind persons can execute valid wills. There is no prohibition in the Wills Act against blind persons making wills. The test for testamentary capacity from Banks v Goodfellow (as endorsed in George Abraham) requires that: (1) the testator understands the nature of the act, (2) knows the extent of property, (3) knows the beneficiaries and can appreciate their claims, and (4) is free from abnormal state of mind. Blindness does not affect any of these elements. A blind person can understand that he is making a will, know what property he owns, know his family members, and have sound judgment. The testamentary capacity test is about mental capacity, not physical abilities like sight. However, because blind testators cannot read the will themselves, courts require evidence that the will was read to them and they understood its contents. This is an evidentiary safeguard, not a prohibition on blind persons making wills. The notes confirm that wills can be executed by blind testators, with appropriate procedures to ensure understanding.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because there is no special form of will required for blind persons under the Wills Act. The Wills Act sets out a single set of formalities for all wills in ss 5-6, regardless of whether the testator is blind, illiterate, or fully sighted. The requirements are the same: will must be in writing, signed by the testator (or by someone at the testator's direction in his presence), with the signature made or acknowledged in the presence of 2 or more witnesses who subscribe the will in the testator's presence. These formalities apply equally to blind testators. What varies is the attestation clause and the evidence needed to prove proper execution. The notes mention 'Attestation clauses variations (where testator is unable to sign, or cannot understand English, or signs with a non-English language, or is blind)' - these are variations in how the attestation clause describes the execution ceremony, not different forms of wills or different legal requirements. A special attestation clause for a blind testator might state: 'The will was read to the blind testator who appeared to understand and approve it.' But this is an evidentiary precaution, not a legal requirement for validity.",
          "D": "While it is true that the standard formalities (writing, signature, witnesses) were satisfied, this answer is incorrect in suggesting no additional requirements may be imposed. The Registrar has power under FJR r 215 to require additional evidence when dealing with wills executed by blind testators. The notes state: 'If Registrar wants to satisfy himself as to: (1) execution of will by blind/illiterate testator (2) terms, conditions and date of execution of will (3) attempted revocation of will, he can require affidavit from any person (FJR r 215).' So while the will is not invalid, and can be admitted to probate, the Registrar may require an affidavit before admitting it. This affidavit would come from the solicitor who drafted the will and/or the witnesses, explaining that the will was read to the blind testator, the testator understood it, and execution was proper. This is a procedural safeguard to ensure the blind testator knew and approved of the will's contents, not a suggestion the will is invalid. Answer B correctly captures this nuance."

        "correct": "The will is valid, but the daughter's gift is void. Section 10 Wills Act provides: 'the beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary CANNOT be witness(es) to the will.' This rule has two effects: (1) if a beneficiary or spouse of a beneficiary witnesses the will, the will itself remains valid (it is not invalidated), but (2) the gift to that beneficiary is void. Here, the son-in-law is the spouse of a beneficiary (the daughter). By witnessing the will, he triggers the s 10 prohibition. The daughter's substantial gift is therefore void - she loses her gift under the will. The rest of the will remains valid and effective for other beneficiaries. This rule serves as a safeguard against undue influence and interested witnesses. If beneficiaries or their spouses could witness wills from which they benefit, they might have incentives to provide false testimony about execution, or might pressure testators during execution. Section 10 deters such conduct by voiding the gift. The notes explain the witness restrictions: '(1) The beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary CANNOT be witness(es) to the will (s 10 WA) [would void their gift].' Note the square brackets - the gift is voided, not the will. Here, since there is another witness (the neighbor) who is competent and independent, the will is validly executed. Only the daughter's gift fails.",

          "A": "This is incorrect because s 10 Wills Act does not invalidate the entire will when a beneficiary or spouse of a beneficiary witnesses it. Rather, s 10 voids only the gift to that beneficiary, leaving the rest of the will valid. The policy is to penalize the interested witness by depriving the beneficiary of the gift, not to invalidate the testator's entire testamentary scheme. The notes clarify: 'The beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary CANNOT be witness(es) to the will (s 10 WA) [would void their gift]' - the bracketed phrase indicates the gift is voided, not the will. If beneficiary-witnessing invalidated entire wills, this would punish the testator and other beneficiaries for the interested witness's involvement, which is contrary to the statute's purpose. Here, the will was properly executed with two witnesses present. The fact that one witness (son-in-law) is the spouse of a beneficiary means the daughter's gift is void, but the will itself stands. The neighbor is a valid, independent witness, so the s 6(2) requirement of 2 witnesses is satisfied by the neighbor and the son-in-law (even if the latter's testimony is interested). The will is valid; only the daughter's gift fails.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 10 Wills Act expressly includes 'spouse of a beneficiary' in the prohibition, not just the beneficiary personally. The section states: 'The beneficiaries, or spouse of a beneficiary CANNOT be witness(es) to the will.' The statute recognizes that spouses of beneficiaries have financial interests aligned with the beneficiaries - if the beneficiary receives a gift, the spouse benefits (through shared marital assets or support). To prevent this aligned interest from biasing testimony, the statute treats spouses of beneficiaries the same as beneficiaries themselves. Here, the son-in-law is not personally a beneficiary under the will (he receives no gift), but he is the 'spouse of a beneficiary' (the daughter receives a gift). This triggers s 10, voiding the daughter's gift. The answer incorrectly treats 'spouse of a beneficiary' as if it were outside the s 10 prohibition. If the statute wanted to prohibit only beneficiaries personally, it would not include the 'or spouse of a beneficiary' language. The inclusion of that language shows that spousal witnessing voids the beneficiary's gift.",
          "D": "This answer invents an election mechanism that does not exist in the statute. Section 10 Wills Act operates automatically and unconditionally: if a spouse of a beneficiary witnesses the will, the beneficiary's gift is void. There is no provision for the beneficiary to elect between taking the gift and having the spouse remain a witness. The statute does not give beneficiaries a choice - the gift is simply void, period. The policy is to prevent interested witnesses from benefiting, not to give beneficiaries options. If beneficiaries could elect to validate their gifts by allowing spousal witnesses, this would undermine the protective purpose of s 10. Moreover, the concept of 'electing' makes little practical sense here. The witnessing occurs at execution, potentially years before death. At that point, the daughter might not even know her spouse witnessed the will or that this voids her gift. By the time of the testator's death, it's too late to 'elect' anything - the witnessing has occurred, s 10 has operated, and the gift is void. The answer might be confusing s 10 with other legal doctrines involving elections (like election between inconsistent rights), but no such doctrine applies here."

The notes state: 'Revocation of wills (s 15 WA): No will or codicil, or any part thereof, shall be revoked otherwise than - (a) [Will revoked by marriage unless 'expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage' (WA s 13)].' This is an automatic revocation that operates by law when the testator marries. Here, the testator executed the will in 2018 when his girlfriend was his girlfriend, not his spouse. The will likely left everything to 'my girlfriend [name]' or similar language. In 2020, when they married, s 13 operated to revoke the entire will automatically. The fact that the beneficiary (girlfriend) later became the spouse does not prevent revocation - what matters is whether the will was 'expressed to be made in contemplation' of THAT specific marriage. The notes confirm: 'Subsequent marriage which revoked the will (Arpinya)' is an issue in contentious probate. For the will to survive the marriage, it would need language like: 'I make this will in contemplation of my intended marriage to [girlfriend's name].' Without such language, the 2020 marriage revoked the 2018 will, and the testator died intestate. The estate passes under the Intestate Succession Act.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 13 Wills Act does not have an exception based on the identity of the beneficiary. The section automatically revokes wills upon marriage unless the will was 'expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage' - this requires explicit language in the will itself indicating the testator was contemplating marriage when executing the will. The fact that the will benefits the person who later became the spouse is irrelevant if the will did not express that it was made in contemplation of the marriage. The rationale for s 13 is that marriage is such a significant change in circumstances that the law presumes the testator would want to reconsider his testamentary dispositions, especially to provide for the new spouse and any children of the marriage. By automatically revoking pre-marriage wills, s 13 forces the testator to execute a new will after marriage, taking into account the changed family circumstances. Here, even though the girlfriend became the wife, the 2018 will was executed before the marriage and did not express that it was made in contemplation of the 2020 marriage. Therefore, s 13 revoked it in 2020.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it suggests the old will remains valid if a new will was executed, which misunderstands how revocation works. The 2018 will was automatically revoked by the 2020 marriage under s 13 WA. Once revoked, the will is dead - it cannot be revived or made valid again. If the testator and wife wanted the same dispositions after marriage, they would need to execute a NEW will (not revive the old one). The answer suggests the old will 'remains valid' with a new will, but this is conceptually confused. What would happen is: (1) the 2018 will is revoked by the 2020 marriage, (2) if the testator executes a new will after marriage with the same or different terms, that new will governs, or (3) if the testator does not execute a new will after marriage, he dies intestate (the old revoked will has no effect). Here, the facts do not indicate any new will was executed after 2020, so the testator died intestate in 2023. The answer incorrectly implies the old will could remain valid, when in fact it was revoked by operation of s 13.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 13 WA revokes the entire will, not just some gifts. The section provides that a will 'is revoked' by marriage (unless made in contemplation of that marriage) - the revocation is total, not partial. There is no provision that saves gifts to the spouse while revoking other gifts. If only gifts to non-spouses were revoked, this would create interpretive problems: which gifts were 'to the wife'? Gifts of specific items? Residuary gifts? Conditional gifts? The law adopts a simpler rule: marriage revokes the entire will. This forces the testator to execute a new will post-marriage that addresses the changed circumstances holistically. If Parliament wanted to save gifts to the new spouse while revoking other gifts, s 13 would say so. Instead, it provides blanket revocation. The answer invents a partial revocation rule that does not exist. The entire will is revoked, and the testator dies intestate unless he executed a new will after marriage."

Section 16 Wills Act provides: 'obliteration, interlineation or other alteration made in any will after the execution thereof shall only have effect if signed by testator and witnesses (except insofar as the will becomes incomprehensible).' The notes state under 'Alterations to wills (s 16 WA)' that an alteration made after execution is effective only if 'signed by testator and witnesses.' Here, the testator crossed out Bob's gift and wrote 'Bob's gift cancelled' with her initials, but 'the two original witnesses do not sign next to this alteration.' Without the witnesses' signatures, the alteration has no effect under s 16. The original will remains operative as executed, including the $50,000 gift to Bob. The testator's intention to cancel the gift is clear, but intention alone is insufficient - the formalities in s 16 must be satisfied. Section 16 requires formalities for alterations for the same reason s 6 requires formalities for execution: to prevent fraud and provide reliable evidence. If alterations could be made informally, anyone with access to the will could cross out gifts and forge initials. The formality requirement (testator's signature + witnesses' signatures) provides security. The exception ('except insofar as the will becomes incomprehensible') means that if the alteration makes the original text unreadable, the gift fails. But merely crossing out text or writing in margins does not usually make the will incomprehensible - the original text can still be read beneath the crossing out.",
        "incorrect": {
          "B": "This is incorrect because testamentary intention alone, without compliance with formalities, is insufficient to alter a will. While the testator's intention to cancel Bob's gift is clear from the crossing out and marginal note, s 16 WA requires that alterations 'made in any will after the execution thereof shall only have effect if signed by testator and witnesses.' The testator's initials next to the marginal note might constitute the testator's signature, but the witnesses did not sign. Without the witnesses' signatures, the alteration has no effect, regardless of how clear the testator's intention is. The policy of requiring formalities for alterations is the same as for execution: to prevent fraud, provide reliable evidence, and ensure solemnity. If testators could validly alter wills by simply crossing out provisions and initialing, this would invite abuse - anyone with access to the will could cross out gifts they disliked. The formality requirement protects against such abuse. If the testator wanted to cancel Bob's gift, she should have: (1) executed a new will without Bob's gift, (2) executed a codicil revoking Bob's gift with proper formalities, or (3) made the alteration with both her signature and witnesses' signatures per s 16. Without compliance with s 16, the original gift stands.",
          "C": "This answer is incorrect because it characterizes the alteration as a 'partial revocation,' which is not how s 16 operates. Section 15 WA sets out the exclusive methods of revocation: (1) by another will or codicil executed in accordance with the Wills Act, (2) by some writing declaring an intention to revoke executed as a will, (3) by burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying the will by the testator with intention to revoke, or (4) by marriage (s 13). Simply crossing out a clause and writing a marginal note does not fit any of these methods. It is not 'another will or codicil' (no proper execution), not a 'writing declaring an intention to revoke' executed as a will (no witnesses), not destruction of the physical will (just marking on it), and not marriage. What the testator attempted is an alteration under s 16, not a revocation under s 15. But the alteration is invalid because the witnesses did not sign. The answer incorrectly treats this as a partial revocation issue when it is actually an alteration issue. If the testator wanted to partially revoke Bob's gift, she would need to execute a codicil or new will properly, per s 15(b).",
          "D": "This answer inverts the s 16 exception. Section 16 provides that alterations have effect only if signed by testator and witnesses, 'except insofar as the will becomes incomprehensible.' This exception means that if an alteration makes the will incomprehensible, the altered portion fails even without signatures - but this works against giving effect to alterations, not in favor of them. In other words, if the testator crosses out text so heavily that the original text is completely unreadable (incomprehensible), then the gift fails because it cannot be determined what the will said. But if the original text remains readable beneath the crossing out (as is usually the case), then the incomprehensibility exception does not apply, and the invalid alteration is ignored, leaving the original gift in place. Here, the facts state the testator 'crosses out' the clause and writes in the margin - this typically does not make the original text incomprehensible. Courts can usually read beneath crossings-out, especially if they are not heavy obliterations. Therefore, the incomprehensibility exception does not apply, and Bob's gift stands because the alteration was not signed by witnesses. The answer suggests Bob's gift stands 'unless' the will becomes incomprehensible, when actually incomprehensibility would cause the gift to fail, not stand."

The solicitor meets with Testator alone, takes detailed notes, asks appropriate questions to test capacity, and drafts the will. The will leaves substantial gifts to Testator's three children. Two weeks later, Testator executes the will and dies one month after that. The will is challenged. How should the solicitor's conduct be evaluated?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The solicitor acted properly according to professional standards. The notes from Low Ah Cheow at [72]-[74] set out the solicitor's duties: '[72] There should be no room for even the slightest doubt or the slightest possibility of mistake on a solicitor's part, in both understanding the testator's intention and expressing that intention in the will. [73] The solicitor should thoroughly discuss all possible legal issues and potential complications, and painstakingly and accurately document his discussions and instructions. [74] The solicitor should also conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation where a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist. The solicitor must be nothing less than a completely independent adviser.' Here, the solicitor: (1) met with Testator alone (ensuring independence from beneficiaries), (2) took detailed notes (satisfying documentation requirements), (3) asked appropriate questions to test capacity (as recommended in Chee Mu Lin Muriel at [60]), and (4) had a long-time relationship with the family (ensuring familiarity while acting for the testator, not the beneficiaries). The urgency is not problematic - many wills are prepared urgently due to terminal illness, which is a sensible reason for urgency. The beneficiaries are the testator's own children (not suspicious third parties), and there is no indication of undue influence or conflicts of interest. The solicitor is the 'family solicitor,' which could raise conflict concerns if he were advising both testator and beneficiaries, but here he met with testator alone. This is exemplary practice under difficult circumstances.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because urgency in will preparation is not itself a breach of professional duties, especially when the urgency is justified by terminal illness. The notes from Low Ah Cheow at [74] mention that 'exceptional restraint and care are called for, if the solicitor has a pre-existing relationship or past dealings with the beneficiary, especially if the will is prepared urgently and executed under unusual circumstances with that sole beneficiary's active involvement.' But the concern is not urgency per se - it is urgency combined with beneficiary involvement and suspicious circumstances. Here, the urgency is explained by terminal illness (3 months to live), which is a legitimate reason for prompt action. The solicitor met with the testator alone (no beneficiary involvement), took detailed notes, and tested capacity. These steps satisfy the 'exceptional restraint and care' requirement. Requiring testators to have extended reflection time would be impractical for those facing imminent death. The law does not prohibit urgent will preparation - it requires solicitors to be especially vigilant about capacity and independence when acting urgently.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because terminal illness is not a ground for refusing to act - indeed, it is often the reason clients seek to make wills. Solicitors have a professional obligation to serve clients, including dying clients who need to put their affairs in order. The notes do not suggest that solicitors must refuse to act for terminally ill clients. What matters is whether the client has testamentary capacity, not whether the client is ill. The test from Banks v Goodfellow (endorsed in George Abraham) asks whether the testator: (1) understands the nature of the act, (2) knows the extent of property, (3) knows beneficiaries and can appreciate their claims, and (4) is free from abnormal state of mind. Physical illness (even terminal illness) does not necessarily affect mental capacity. Many terminally ill persons retain full testamentary capacity until very close to death. If the solicitor assessed capacity (as here, through 'asking appropriate questions') and was satisfied the testator had capacity, there is no reason to refuse to act. Refusing to act would deny dying persons the ability to make wills, which contradicts the purpose of succession law.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because medical certification of capacity is recommended but not mandatory. Chee Mu Lin Muriel at [60] states: 'if a testator was known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she was allowed to sign the will.' But this guidance applies specifically to testators 'known to be suffering from any mental infirmity' - i.e., conditions affecting the mind like dementia, psychiatric disorders, or cognitive impairment. Terminal cancer is a physical illness that does not necessarily affect mental capacity. Unless the cancer has metastasized to the brain or the testator is heavily medicated in a way that impairs cognition, there is no reason to assume cancer affects testamentary capacity. The notes emphasize that the 'solicitor should ask the appropriate questions to ascertain the testator's capacity to understand the contents of the will' (Chee Mu Lin Muriel at [60]). Here, the solicitor did ask appropriate questions to test capacity. This is the solicitor's primary duty. Medical certification provides additional evidence but is not mandatory in all cases, especially where there is no indication of mental infirmity and the solicitor properly assessed capacity."

The notes state: 'Solicitor who drafted client's will or another solicitor from the same law practice can be appointed as the executor/trustee under that will if he is not a beneficiary/legatee under the will (Rajaratnam Kumar).' This confirms that: (1) solicitors can be executors, (2) the solicitor does not need to have personally drafted the will - another solicitor from the same firm can be executor, and (3) the key restriction is that the solicitor-executor cannot also be a beneficiary/legatee (receiving a gift) under the will. Here, Solicitor B is from the same firm (Law Firm X) as Solicitor A who drafted the will, and Solicitor B is appointed as executor. As long as Solicitor B does not receive any gift or legacy under the will, he can act as executor. Executors are entitled to commission under s 66 PAA as compensation for their services in administering the estate. This is not a 'benefit' that creates a conflict - it is remuneration for work done. The notes confirm: 'The testator can set and fix the remuneration of the Executor (though in the absence of an express stipulation in the will, s 66 PAA will apply).' Solicitor-executors routinely charge commission under s 66 PAA (up to 5% of asset values), and this is permissible professional remuneration.",

The notes from Rajaratnam Kumar explicitly permit this: 'Solicitor who drafted client's will or another solicitor from the same law practice can be appointed as the executor/trustee under that will if he is not a beneficiary/legatee under the will.' The law recognizes that appointing a solicitor as executor can be beneficial - solicitors have expertise in estate administration, knowledge of the testator's affairs, and professional obligations. The potential conflict is not the executorship itself, but rather if the solicitor-executor also receives a gift under the will. If the solicitor is executor only (no gift), there is no conflict - the solicitor is being compensated for professional services (executorship) through commission under s 66 PAA, not receiving a windfall gift. The answer incorrectly assumes all solicitor-executors from the drafting firm face disqualifying conflicts, when the law permits this arrangement subject to the restriction on being a beneficiary.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the notes explicitly state that 'another solicitor from the same law practice' (not just the drafter) can be appointed as executor. There is no requirement that the solicitor who personally drafted the will be the executor. Often, different solicitors in a firm have different roles - one might be the client-facing solicitor who takes instructions and drafts (Solicitor A), while another might be the senior partner or specialist in estate administration who is better suited to be executor (Solicitor B). The testator has freedom to appoint any solicitor from the firm (or anyone else) as executor. What matters is the testator's confidence in the appointee's ability to administer the estate faithfully and competently, not whether that person personally drafted the will. If only the drafter could be executor, this would restrict testators' choice unnecessarily. The law permits flexible arrangements where the drafter and executor are different people, even within the same firm, as long as the executor is not a beneficiary.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no requirement that solicitor-executors waive commission to avoid conflict of interest. Section 66 PAA provides for executors' commission as compensation for their services.

This rate of commission may be as high as 5% of the value of the assets collected.' Solicitor-executors are entitled to this commission just like lay executors. The commission is not a 'conflict of interest' - it is fair compensation for the substantial work of estate administration (collecting assets, paying debts, preparing accounts, distributing to beneficiaries, filing tax returns, etc.). If solicitors had to waive commission, few would agree to act as executors, which would harm testators who want professional executors. The conflict that the law prohibits is being both executor and beneficiary (receiving a gift), not being executor and receiving commission for executorship services. Answer B correctly identifies the actual restriction."

Section 15(b) Wills Act provides that a will can be revoked 'by another will or codicil executed in the manner by this Act required.' The notes explain typical will clauses: 'Revocation clause - e.g. \"I revoke all former wills, codicils and other testamentary dispositions made by me\"' and further state: 'If there is no revocation clause, wills previously made may be admitted to proof and the present will would have to be construed with the earlier will, so far as consistent, as forming the will.' Here, the 2018 will contains an express revocation clause that revokes 'all former wills' - this includes the 2015 will. The 2018 will, having been executed with proper formalities (as required by s 15(b)), operates to revoke the 2015 will. Therefore, only the 2018 will should be admitted to probate. The 2015 will is effectively 'dead' once the 2018 will was executed with its revocation clause. The fact that both wills were found together is not legally significant - what matters is the express revocation in the later will. The revocation clause is standard practice in will drafting precisely to avoid ambiguity about which will governs. It makes clear that the latest will supersedes all previous wills.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because temporal priority does not determine which will prevails. The general principle of wills is that later wills supersede earlier wills to the extent of any inconsistency - and where there is an express revocation clause, the later will completely revokes the earlier will. Section 15(b) WA contemplates that wills can be revoked 'by another will or codicil' executed properly. The whole point of testamentary freedom is that testators can change their minds and execute new wills. If the first will always took priority, testators could never effectively revoke or change their wills, which would be absurd. The law gives priority to the LATEST valid will that expresses the testator's final intentions. Here, the 2018 will is later than the 2015 will and contains an express revocation clause. The 2018 will therefore prevails. The 2015 will, though executed first, has been superseded and should not be admitted to probate.",

The notes explain: 'If there is no revocation clause, wills previously made may be admitted to proof and the present will would have to be construed with the earlier will, so far as consistent, as forming the will.' This rule applies when a later will is silent about earlier wills - in that case, courts try to construe them together, treating the later will as supplementing or modifying the earlier will where they are inconsistent. But when the later will contains an express revocation clause (as here), it completely revokes all earlier wills. The clause 'I revoke all former wills, codicils and other testamentary dispositions made by me' is unambiguous - it revokes the 2015 will in its entirety. There is no room to read them together. The 2018 will stands alone as the testator's complete testamentary disposition. The answer incorrectly suggests both wills should be construed together, ignoring the effect of the express revocation clause.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the question of which will to admit to probate is a legal question determined by the rules of revocation under s 15 WA, not a discretionary judgment about which will 'better reflects' family circumstances. Courts do not choose between competing valid wills based on which seems fairer or more reasonable - they determine which will is legally operative based on execution and revocation rules. Here, the 2018 will contains an express revocation clause that revokes the 2015 will. Therefore, the 2018 will is legally operative regardless of whether it 'better reflects' family circumstances. If the 2018 will is unfair or irrational, family members might challenge it on grounds of lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence, or fraud - but assuming the 2018 will is valid, it prevails over the earlier will. Courts do not have general discretion to prefer earlier wills because they seem more reasonable. The answer suggests a discretionary approach that has no basis in the law of wills."

IF T wants the outstanding mortgage to be paid from any other assets so that the recipient is to receive the property free of any encumbrance, it has to be stated clearly in the will.' Section 26 Civil Law Act provides the default rule that beneficiaries of mortgaged property take subject to the mortgage - they cannot claim that the mortgage should be paid from the estate's movable property (cash, investments, personal property). This rule applies unless the testator expresses a contrary intention in the will. Here, the will simply gives 'my house at 123 Orchard Road to my daughter Lisa' without addressing the mortgage. Applying the s 26 default rule, Lisa takes the house subject to the $800,000 mortgage. If the testator wanted Lisa to receive the house free and clear, the will should have stated: 'I give my house at 123 Orchard Road to my daughter Lisa, and I direct that the outstanding mortgage be paid from my residuary estate' or similar language showing intention to exonerate the property.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it inverts the default rule in s 26 Civil Law Act. The default is that mortgaged property passes WITH the mortgage attached - the devisee cannot claim that the mortgage be paid from other assets. Section 26(1) CLA specifically provides that beneficiaries of land cannot claim payment of the mortgage debt out of the testator's movable property (personalty). The policy is that when a testator makes a specific devise of property, the testator is giving that specific property in its current state, including any encumbrances. If the testator wanted to give the property free of mortgage, the testator should say so expressly in the will. Without such express language, the beneficiary takes subject to the mortgage. Lisa receives the house worth $2 million, but she also assumes the $800,000 mortgage. Her net benefit is $1.2 million. The other assets in the estate go to other beneficiaries as provided in the will, not to pay Lisa's mortgage.",

If the will is silent, s 26 CLA provides that the devisee takes subject to the mortgage. The mortgage is not paid from the residuary estate by default. If this were the rule, it would mean that residuary beneficiaries would bear the burden of mortgages on specific devises, which would be unfair and contrary to most testators' intentions. The law assumes that a specific devise of mortgaged property is a gift of the property as it stands, including the mortgage. If the testator intended otherwise (mortgage to be paid from residue), the testator must state this clearly.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because taking property subject to a mortgage does not require the beneficiary to immediately sell the property and pay the mortgage. 'Subject to mortgage' means the beneficiary receives the property with the mortgage debt attached - the beneficiary becomes responsible for the mortgage debt and can choose how to deal with it. Options include: (1) keep the property and continue making mortgage payments, (2) refinance the mortgage, (3) pay off the mortgage with personal funds, or (4) sell the property and use proceeds to pay the mortgage (keeping any surplus). The law does not force the beneficiary to sell. Here, Lisa receives the house subject to the $800,000 mortgage. She could live in the house and take over the mortgage payments, or she could sell the house for $2 million, pay the $800,000 mortgage, and keep the remaining $1.2 million.

Can apply to court but will only be granted in very exceptional circumstances - but executor is more likely to gain leave of court since he was explicitly indicated by testator in the will.' Section 400 Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act creates a prohibition on undischarged bankrupts acting as personal representatives, based on concerns about financial prudence and integrity. However, this is not an absolute prohibition - the court has discretion to grant leave. The distinction between executors and administrators is significant: for administrators (intestacy), leave is very unlikely because the court has discretion whom to appoint and will simply appoint someone else. But for executors named in wills, courts are more willing to grant leave to respect the testator's choice. The testator expressly chose his brother knowing the brother's capabilities and trustworthiness (even if the testator did not anticipate the bankruptcy). Courts balance the testator's testamentary freedom against the policy concerns underlying s 400. Leave might be granted if: (1) the brother's bankruptcy does not suggest dishonesty, (2) the estate administration is straightforward, (3) there are no other suitable executors, or (4) the brother can demonstrate he will act responsibly.",

The notes state that undischarged bankrupts 'CANNOT be executors or administrators (s 400 IRDA)... Can apply to court but will only be granted in very exceptional circumstances.' The word 'CANNOT' refers to the default rule without leave, not an absolute prohibition. If the prohibition were absolute, there would be no point in mentioning that one 'can apply to court' for leave. The law recognizes that while bankruptcy raises concerns about financial prudence, there may be exceptional cases where a bankrupt should be allowed to act. For executors specifically, the notes indicate courts are 'more likely to gain leave of court since he was explicitly indicated by testator in the will.' This shows the prohibition is not absolute - the testator's choice carries weight. An absolute prohibition would disregard the testator's express wishes, which would be a significant interference with testamentary freedom. The answer overstates the prohibition by calling it absolute.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because it ignores the s 400 IRDA restriction on bankrupts. While executors named in wills generally have the right to act, this right is subject to statutory disqualifications including bankruptcy.

These are statutory disqualifications that override the general right of named executors to act. If named executors could 'always act' regardless of circumstances, these statutory provisions would be meaningless. The reality is that named executors can usually act, but are subject to disqualifications (age, mental capacity, bankruptcy). For bankruptcy, the disqualification is not absolute (leave can be sought), but neither can the bankrupt act 'without restriction.' The answer incorrectly suggests no restrictions apply.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because bankruptcy does not automatically revoke the appointment - it creates a bar to acting that requires either obtaining leave or seeking alternative grant. The notes do not suggest that bankruptcy revokes the executorship appointment. Rather, the appointment remains valid, but the bankrupt executor cannot act without leave under s 400 IRDA. If the bankrupt does not seek leave, or if leave is denied, then letters of administration with will annexed under s 13 PAA might be appropriate. But this is not automatic - it requires the bankrupt executor to either renounce or fail to apply. The process would be: (1) brother applies for probate, (2) court notes he is bankrupt and asks if he seeks leave under s 400, (3) if he seeks leave and it is granted, he gets probate; if he does not seek leave or leave is denied, (4) he may renounce, or (5) others may seek letters of administration with will annexed under s 13 PAA.

      "question": "Testator executes a will with a clause appointing guardians: 'I appoint my friend Peter Lee to be guardian of my minor children, X and Y.' Both children are 10 years old when the will is executed. Testator dies when the children are 15 years old. Testator's spouse survived him. What is the effect of this guardian appointment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Peter becomes the sole guardian of X and Y, replacing the surviving spouse.",
        "B": "Peter acts as guardian jointly with the surviving spouse, unless the spouse objects.",
        "C": "The appointment is void because guardians cannot be appointed by will when a spouse survives.",
        "D": "Peter becomes guardian only when X and Y turn 18 years old."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Peter acts jointly with the surviving spouse unless the spouse objects. The notes state: 'The Testator has free choice to appoint a testamentary guardian, and that guardian appointed under the will of the deceased parent shall act jointly with the surviving parent of the infant so long as the other parent remains alive, unless that parent objects to his so acting (s 7(3) Guardianship of Infants Act). If the surviving parent objects, the testamentary guardian can apply to court for orders to be made under s 7(4) GIA.' This reflects the law's balance between respecting the deceased testator's choice of guardian and the surviving parent's parental rights. The surviving spouse is the natural guardian of X and Y (as their parent). The testamentary guardian (Peter) appointed in the will does not replace the surviving spouse, but rather acts alongside the spouse as a joint guardian. This joint guardianship continues unless the spouse objects under s 7(3) GIA. If the spouse does object, Peter can apply to court under s 7(4) for orders - the court will determine what arrangement is in the children's best interests. Here, when the testator dies (children age 15), Peter's appointment takes effect, and he becomes joint guardian with the surviving spouse. The spouse can object if she does not want to co-guardian with Peter, triggering a court application.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because the testamentary guardian does not replace the surviving parent as sole guardian. The notes explain: 'the guardian appointed under the will of the deceased parent shall act jointly with the surviving parent of the infant so long as the other parent remains alive' (s 7(3) GIA). The policy is that the surviving parent retains parental rights and responsibilities - the death of one parent does not terminate the other parent's guardianship. The testamentary guardian augments, rather than replaces, the surviving parent's role. If testamentary guardians could replace surviving parents as sole guardians, this would be a dramatic interference with parental rights. A deceased parent cannot unilaterally strip the surviving parent of guardianship by appointing someone else in a will. The law respects the testator's wishes by making the testamentary guardian a joint guardian, while respecting the surviving parent's rights by preserving the parent's guardianship. Only if both parents die does the testamentary guardian become sole guardian (or if the surviving parent successfully objects under s 7(3) and the court removes them under s 7(4)).",
          "C": "This is incorrect because testamentary guardians CAN be appointed even when a spouse survives - they simply act jointly with the spouse. The notes confirm that testators 'can appoint testamentary guardians for the children' and that 'The Testator has free choice to appoint a testamentary guardian.' There is no rule voiding guardian appointments when a spouse survives. Section 7 Guardianship of Infants Act specifically contemplates this situation and provides for joint guardianship. If guardian appointments were void when a spouse survives, there would be no need for s 7(3)'s provisions about joint action and the spouse's right to object. The statute clearly assumes testamentary guardians can be appointed and will act alongside surviving parents. The answer incorrectly suggests the appointment is void, when it is actually valid and effective (subject to the joint guardianship arrangement).",
          "D": "This is incorrect because guardianship is for minors (under 21 years old), not for adults. The appointment takes effect when the testator dies and continues until the children reach age 21 (age of majority). At age 18 in Singapore, individuals are adults for most purposes, but guardianship under the Guardianship of Infants Act continues until age 21. In any event, guardianship is needed precisely when the children ARE minors, not after they turn 18. Here, the testator dies when the children are 15 - they need a guardian from age 15 to 21. Peter's appointment takes effect at the testator's death (when children are 15), not when they turn 18. If the appointment only took effect at 18, it would be pointless because by that time the children are adults (or nearly so) and don't need guardians. The answer confuses when the appointment takes effect (at testator's death) with when guardianship ends (when children reach majority)."

      "question": "Testator's will contains a clause: 'I give my collection of antique watches to my nephew Tom.' At the time of the will's execution, Testator owned 15 antique watches. Before Testator's death, Testator sold 10 of the watches to fund medical expenses, leaving only 5 watches at death. What does Tom receive?",

        "A": "All 15 watches, or their cash equivalent value if the estate cannot recover them.",

        "D": "Nothing, because the gift fails entirely due to ademption."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Tom receives only the 5 remaining watches because the gift of the 10 sold watches adeemed. The notes explain 'Ademption: failure of gift of property, because property does not exist at testator's death (Low Gim Har).' Three scenarios cause ademption: '(1) The subject-matter of the gift is disposed of or destroyed, e.g. shares sold (Low Gim Har, [58a]); (2) It ceases to conform to its description, e.g. X company taken over by Y company, and shares in Y company issued in exchange for shares in X company (Low Gim Har, [58b]); (3) The nature of the gift has changed its character...' Here, the testator sold 10 of the 15 watches during his lifetime. Those 10 watches no longer exist in the estate at death - they have been 'disposed of.' This is classic ademption under scenario (1). The gift as to those 10 watches fails (adeems). However, 5 watches remain and still match the description 'my collection of antique watches.' Tom receives these 5 remaining watches. The gift is partially adeemed (as to the 10 sold) and partially takes effect (as to the 5 remaining). This is a specific gift of specific property. When specific property is sold before death, that part of the gift adeems. The beneficiary has no claim to the sale proceeds or to compensation - the gift simply fails as to the disposed-of items.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because ademption means the gift fails entirely as to the disposed-of property, with no right to compensation or equivalent value. The notes are clear that ademption is 'failure of gift of property, because property does not exist at testator's death.' When specific property is sold before death, the beneficiary receives nothing in respect of that property - not the cash proceeds, not damages, not equivalent property. The law distinguishes between specific gifts (of particular items) and general gifts (of money or fungible goods). A specific gift of 'my antique watch collection' is a gift of those particular watches. If the testator sells some watches, that part of the gift fails. The testator might have used the sale proceeds for medical expenses, or might have given them away, or they might remain in the estate as cash - but Tom has no claim to them. The will gives Tom the watches, not 'the watches or their value.' If the testator wanted Tom to receive the value if the watches were sold, the will would need language like 'my watch collection or, if sold, the proceeds thereof.' Without such language, ademption operates to fail the gift as to sold items.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because ademption does not give rise to damages or compensation. When a specific gift adeems, it simply fails - the beneficiary has no claim against the estate for the loss. The notes do not mention any right to damages for ademption. The policy of ademption is that specific gifts are of specific property, and if that property is no longer in the estate at death, the testator is presumed to have intended the gift not to take effect. The testator had the right to deal with his property during lifetime, including selling it. By selling the 10 watches, the testator implicitly revoked that portion of the gift. Tom cannot claim damages for the testator's exercise of ownership rights over his own property. If Tom wanted protection against ademption, the will could have created a general legacy ('$100,000 for Tom to buy antique watches') rather than a specific devise ('my antique watch collection'). General legacies do not adeem because they are satisfied from general estate assets. But specific devises adeem when the specific property is gone.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because ademption is partial, not total, when only some of the gifted property has been disposed of. The notes explain ademption but do not suggest that partial disposal causes total failure of the gift. If 10 of 15 watches are sold, the gift adeems as to those 10 but remains effective as to the 5 that still exist. The will gives 'my collection of antique watches' - at death, the collection consists of 5 watches, and Tom receives those 5. If ademption were all-or-nothing (total failure if any watches sold), this would be harsh and contrary to the testator's likely intention. The testator presumably wanted Tom to have whatever watches remained. The law gives effect to this intention by allowing partial ademption. Total ademption would occur only if ALL the watches were sold before death, leaving none in the collection. Here, 5 remain, so Tom receives them. The answer incorrectly applies total failure when only partial ademption has occurred."

      "options": {
        "A": "Alice receives $50,000, Ben receives $50,000, and Carol receives nothing due to insufficient funds.",

        "D": "The will fails entirely due to insufficient assets, and the estate passes by intestacy."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The gifts abate proportionately, with each child receiving approximately $33,333. The notes explain 'Abatement: rateable reduction in gifts, because there are insufficient assets to go around. If there is insufficient money to pay cash gifts, then the legacies are reduced and each beneficiary takes PARI PASSU.' The total of the three gifts is $150,000 ($50,000 × 3), but only $100,000 is available. Rather than paying gifts in order until funds run out (which would be unfair to later beneficiaries), the law applies abatement. Abatement reduces all gifts proportionately so each beneficiary receives the same proportion of their intended gift. Here, the estate has $100,000 available for the three $50,000 gifts. Each gift is abated by the same proportion: $100,000 ÷ $150,000 = 66.67%. So each child receives 66.67% of their $50,000 gift = $33,333. This way, all three children are treated equally - they each lose one-third of their gifts due to the shortfall. Abatement applies to gifts of the same class (here, three equal cash legacies). If there were different classes of gifts (specific gifts, general legacies, residuary gifts), different abatement rules might apply, but here all three gifts are the same type (general pecuniary legacies).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because abatement operates proportionately (pari passu), not in order of priority. The notes state: 'If there is insufficient money to pay cash gifts, then the legacies are reduced and each beneficiary takes PARI PASSU.' 'Pari passu' means proportionately or equally. There is no rule that earlier-named beneficiaries get paid in full while later-named beneficiaries get nothing. Such a rule would be arbitrary and unfair. Why should Alice and Ben receive their full gifts merely because they are listed first in the will, while Carol receives nothing merely because she is listed third? The testator gave equal gifts ($50,000 each) to all three children, indicating equal treatment. Abatement respects this equal treatment by reducing all gifts by the same proportion. If the testator wanted Alice and Ben to have priority over Carol, the testator would need to express this clearly (e.g., 'I give $50,000 to Alice and $50,000 to Ben, and if sufficient funds remain, $50,000 to Carol'). Without such language, all three gifts abate proportionately.",
          "B": "This answer reaches the correct dollar amount ($33,333 each) but uses incorrect reasoning. The notes distinguish between 'distributed equally' and abatement. The estate is not being distributed 'equally' in the sense of equal treatment ignoring the will's terms - rather, the gifts are being abated proportionately according to the will's terms. The will does not say 'divide my estate equally among my three children' (which would be a direction for equal distribution). Instead, the will gives specific amounts ($50,000 each), but insufficient assets exist to honor these amounts. Abatement is the legal doctrine that reduces the gifts proportionately. The answer is substantively correct (each child gets $33,333) but fails to articulate the correct legal basis (abatement, not equal distribution). If this were equal distribution ignoring the will, the same result might occur even if the will gave different amounts to each child, which would be wrong. The answer confuses the mechanism (abatement) with the result ($33,333 each).",
          "D": "This is incorrect because insufficient assets do not cause the entire will to fail. The will remains valid and takes effect to the extent possible. The doctrine of abatement allows the will to operate even when there are insufficient assets to satisfy all gifts - the gifts are simply reduced proportionately. Only the specific gifts in question are affected; other provisions of the will (executorship, guardianship, etc.) remain fully effective. If the will also contained other provisions (e.g., specific gifts of property, funeral directions), those would be unaffected by the shortfall in cash. Even as to the cash gifts, they don't fail entirely - they are reduced through abatement. The answer incorrectly suggests that any insufficiency of assets invalidates the will and triggers intestacy. This would frustrate the testator's intentions unnecessarily. The law seeks to give effect to wills to the greatest extent possible, using doctrines like abatement to deal with practical problems like insufficient assets. Only if the entire estate is consumed by debts (nothing left for beneficiaries) would there be nothing to distribute under the will."

        "correct": "Adam receives one-third, and two-thirds passes by intestacy. The notes explain that section 26 Wills Act does NOT apply to class gifts: 'S 26 WA does NOT apply to a class gift (Loke Soh Lui, [21]).' The notes further explain: 'e.g. \"all my natural and lawful sons\", \"my children\", \"all my children including John\" or excluding a named person are class gifts (Loke Soh Lui, [17], [60]).' Here, the gift to 'my children' is a class gift - it describes a class of people rather than naming specific individuals. For class gifts where a class member predeceases, the notes state: 'In a class gift, the gift vis-à-vis the deceased child automatically lapses and the gift will be redistributed to the rest of the surviving children in equal shares.' So Betty's and Charlie's shares lapse. Normally these would be redistributed to Adam, but the notes also state: '(for a residue) If beneficiary dies before testator, the gift of a share in residue fails and will be distributed according to intestacy rules in ISA.' Because this is a residuary gift (not just any gift), when class members predecease, their shares fail and pass by intestacy. Adam (the surviving child) receives his one-third share. Betty's one-third and Charlie's one-third fail and pass by intestacy under the Intestate Succession Act.",

The notes state: '(for a residue) If beneficiary dies before testator, the gift of a share in residue fails and will be distributed according to intestacy rules in ISA.' For residuary class gifts, when a class member predeceases, that share does not automatically go to surviving class members - instead, it fails and passes by intestacy. The policy is that the residuary estate is the testator's 'catch-all' - what remains after specific gifts. When a residuary beneficiary predeceases, the testator's will does not cover that share, so it falls into intestacy. If the will simply gave 'my children' a specific sum or specific property (not residue), then the surviving child (Adam) might receive the entire gift. But for residue, the failed shares pass by intestacy. This means Adam gets one-third, and the remaining two-thirds are distributed under ISA (likely to Adam and possibly other family members depending on who else survives).",
          "B": "This is incorrect because section 26 Wills Act does not apply to class gifts. Section 26 applies when the testator names specific children as beneficiaries and those named children predecease. The notes explain: 'Naming each child by name is not a class gift and will be covered by s 26 (Loke Soh Lui, [17]), e.g. \"to John, Paul, Jogee and Sarah\".' If the will said 'I give my residuary estate to Adam, Betty, and Charlie' (naming each), then s 26 might apply, causing Betty's share to go to her children (the grandchildren). But here, the will says 'my children' - a class description, not individual names. Section 26 does not apply to such class gifts. Furthermore, even if s 26 applied, it would not apply to Charlie's share because Charlie has no children ('leaving issue' is a requirement for s 26). The answer incorrectly applies s 26 to a class gift and incorrectly assumes it applies to Charlie who has no issue.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it misapplies section 26 Wills Act to a class gift and to a beneficiary without children. First, s 26 does not apply to class gifts - the gift to 'my children' is a class gift not covered by s 26. Second, even if s 26 applied, it only operates when the deceased child 'leaving issue' - Charlie has no children, so s 26 would not apply to his share even in a named gift scenario. Third, when s 26 applies (which it doesn't here), the gift goes to the deceased child's children (issue), not to the deceased child's estate. The notes state s 26 provides that the gift 'shall take effect as if the death of that person had happened immediately after the death of the testator' - this creates a fiction that the child survived just long enough to inherit, then died, passing to their issue. It doesn't mean the gift goes to the child's estate for general distribution. The answer is wrong on multiple levels: wrong statute (s 26 doesn't apply to class gifts), wrong beneficiary (Charlie has no issue), and wrong distribution mechanism (not to estates)."

If the execution conformed to Malaysian internal law (which the facts indicate it did), then under s 5(2)(b)(i), the will is treated as properly executed for Singapore purposes even though it does not comply with Singapore formalities. Section 5(2) recognizes that wills may be executed in different jurisdictions with different formality requirements, and validates wills that comply with the law of certain connected jurisdictions. The testator's later change of domicile to Singapore does not invalidate a will that was validly executed under the law of the domicile at execution. Section 5(7) confirms: 'The construction of a will shall not be altered by reason of any change in the testator's domicile after the execution of the will.'",

While Singapore law normally requires two witnesses (s 6(2) WA), s 5(2) allows wills to be treated as properly executed if they comply with the law of certain other jurisdictions. The policy is to facilitate international testamentary dispositions - if testators had to comply with the formalities of every possible jurisdiction where they might later be domiciled or where they might own property, will-making would be extremely complicated. Section 5(2) provides that compliance with the law of the place of execution, or the testator's domicile at execution or death, among others, is sufficient. Here, the will complied with Malaysian law (the domicile at execution). This is sufficient under s 5(2)(b)(i), even though it does not comply with Singapore law. The will can be admitted to probate in Singapore despite having only one witness, because one witness was sufficient under Malaysian law.",

The section states the will is properly executed if execution conformed to the internal law 'in the territory where the testator was domiciled at the time - (i) when the will was executed; or (ii) of his death.' The 'or' indicates these are alternatives, not cumulative requirements. Here, the testator was domiciled in Malaysia at execution, and the will complied with Malaysian law. This satisfies s 5(2)(b)(i). It does not matter that the testator later changed domicile to Singapore and died domiciled in Singapore - the will was already validly executed under s 5(2)(b)(i) based on domicile at execution. If the answer were correct (must comply with law of domicile at death), then testators who changed domicile would need to re-execute their wills to comply with the new domicile's formalities, which would be impractical. Section 5 avoids this by validating wills that comply with any of several connected jurisdictions' laws.",

If the will was validly executed under s 5(2) WA based on compliance with foreign law, it stands on its own without need for confirmation. A codicil is a supplementary testamentary document that amends or supplements a will, executed with the same formalities as a will. Codicils might be used to make changes to a will, but they are not used to 'confirm' or validate wills. If a testator wanted to ensure a foreign will complied with Singapore formalities after moving to Singapore, the testator could execute a new will or codicil in Singapore with two witnesses - but this would create a new testamentary disposition, not merely validate the old one.

Bob was promised 'all remaining sums' - but after Alice takes her (abated) share of $180,000, there are no remaining sums. Bob's gift is specific: it is a gift of 'remaining sums.' Since no remaining sums exist, his gift adeems (fails due to the property not existing). This distinguishes Alice's and Bob's positions. Alice has a general pecuniary legacy of a specific dollar amount ($200,000), which can be satisfied from any estate assets. When insufficient funds exist to pay the full amount, her gift abates.

They are not treated equally. Alice's gift has priority because it is a specific amount that must be paid first. Bob gets only what remains. When Alice's (abated) gift consumes the entire estate, Bob's residuary gift fails because there is no residue. If both gifts were general legacies (e.g., '$200,000 to Alice and $100,000 to Bob' with only $180,000 available), then proportionate abatement would apply. But residuary gifts are paid last, after general legacies.",
          "C": "This answer reaches the correct result but uses incorrect reasoning. Alice's gift is not a 'specific legacy' - it is a general pecuniary legacy. A specific legacy is a gift of specific property (e.g., 'my Rolex watch,' 'my shares in X company'). A general legacy is a gift of money or fungible property not tied to specific items (e.g., '$200,000,' '100 shares'). Alice's gift of $200,000 is a general legacy - the executor can satisfy it from any cash or assets in the estate. Bob's gift is a residuary gift. The reason Alice's gift has priority is not because it is 'specific' but because general legacies are paid before residuary gifts in the order of abatement. The typical order is: (1) residuary estate bears debts and expenses, (2) general legacies are paid, (3) specific legacies are paid, (4) any remaining goes to residuary beneficiaries. Here, after paying Alice's general legacy (abated to $180,000), nothing remains for Bob's residuary gift. The answer uses wrong terminology ('specific legacy')."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Section 26 does not apply because the will contains a gift-over provision showing contrary intention. Section 26 Wills Act states: 'Where any person being a child or other issue of the testator... shall die in the lifetime of the testator leaving issue... that devise or bequest shall not lapse, but shall take effect as if the death of that person had happened immediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.' The key phrase is 'unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.' Here, the testator expressly provided for the contingency of Diana predeceasing: 'but if Diana shall predecease me then to Diana's children in equal shares.' This gift-over clause shows the testator's intention about what should happen if Diana predeceases - the house should go to Diana's children as per the gift-over. This contrary intention displaces s 26. The notes explain gift-over provisions: 'Gift-over provision: a provision by which a \"substitute\" beneficiary can \"take over\" the gift to the original beneficiary.' Here, Diana's children are the substitute beneficiaries. They take under the express gift-over provision, not under s 26. The result is the same (Diana's children get the house), but the mechanism is the gift-over, not s 26.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This answer reaches the correct result (Diana's children receive the house) but identifies the wrong legal mechanism. Section 26 WA does not apply when the will contains a gift-over provision because the gift-over shows 'contrary intention' that displaces s 26. The notes state s 26 applies 'unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.' A gift-over provision is the paradigm example of contrary intention - the testator has explicitly addressed what happens if the primary beneficiary predeceases. When the testator includes such a provision, the court gives effect to it rather than applying the statutory default in s 26. Diana's children receive the house, but they receive it under the gift-over clause ('if Diana shall predecease me then to Diana's children'), not under s 26. The distinction matters for interpretation: the gift-over's specific terms control (e.g., 'in equal shares'), not s 26's terms.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 26 and gift-over provisions are mutually exclusive - if the will contains a gift-over showing contrary intention, s 26 does not apply. There is no 'double application' where Diana's children take through both mechanisms. The notes state s 26 applies 'unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will' - the presence of a gift-over is a contrary intention that prevents s 26 from operating. If both applied simultaneously, there would be confusion: do Diana's children take under s 26's terms or the gift-over's terms? What if they differ (e.g., gift-over says 'in unequal shares' but s 26 implies equal distribution)? The law avoids this by giving precedence to the testator's express provisions (gift-over) over statutory defaults (s 26). Here, the testator expressly said 'if Diana shall predecease me then to Diana's children in equal shares' - this controls, and s 26 is displaced.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 26 applies to both specific devises and residuary gifts, not only to residuary gifts. The notes explain: 'S 26 also covers any residuary estate named to specifically go to the named beneficiary' - this shows s 26 covers residuary gifts. But s 26 also applies to specific devises. The section states: 'Where any person being a child or other issue of the testator to whom any real or personal estate shall be devised or bequeathed...' The phrase 'devised' refers to gifts of real property (land), while 'bequeathed' refers to gifts of personal property. A house is real property, so a gift of a house is a 'devise.' Section 26 covers devises, so it would apply to this gift of a house if there were no contrary intention. The answer incorrectly limits s 26 to residuary gifts. In fact, s 26 applies to any gift (specific or residuary) to the testator's child or issue who predeceases leaving issue, unless contrary intention appears."

An act of one executor can bind the estate and other executors.' This is from Tacplas Property Services v Lee Peter Michael. The principle is that executors, unless the will specifies otherwise, can act both jointly (together) and severally (individually). This is different from the rule for administrators. When one of multiple appointed executors renounces, the remaining executor(s) can proceed alone. The notes explain: 'Effect of Renunciation of probate: (1) precludes person from applying for grant, (2) but court can allow person to withdraw renunciation for benefit of estate or interested persons (s 5 PAA).' Mr. Lee's renunciation removes him from the picture, but does not prevent Mr. Tan from acting. Mr. Tan was validly appointed as executor in the will, and executors can act individually. After Mr. Lee renounces (in Form 53), Mr. Tan can apply for probate on his own. Only one executor is needed - the notes confirm in the testate/intestate comparison: 'Only one (1) executor is required.'",

In contrast, the notes state: 'administrators of an estate MUST act jointly and the act of one administrator cannot bind the estate, unless that act was ratified by all administrators.' The default rule for executors is joint AND several action (either together or individually). The default rule for administrators is joint action only (must act together). Here, the will appoints 'my solicitor, Mr. Lee, and my accountant, Mr. Tan' without specifying they must act jointly only. Therefore, they can act jointly and severally. After Mr. Lee renounces, Mr. Tan can act alone. If the will said 'to act jointly,' then the answer might be correct, but no such language appears here.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because letters of administration with will annexed (LA with will annexed) are only needed when no executor can or will act. Section 13(1) PAA provides: 'Where there is no executor who can or does appear and extract probate, letters of administration with the will annexed may be granted...' Here, there IS an executor who can and will act - Mr. Tan. Only Mr. Lee has renounced; Mr. Tan is willing and able to act. The notes explain: 'If there is no executor who can or does appear and extract probate, letters of administration with the will annexed may be granted to such person(s) the court considers the fittest (s 13(1) PAA).' This applies when ALL appointed executors are unable or unwilling to act (due to death, incapacity, renunciation, refusal, etc.). But when at least one appointed executor can act, probate should be granted to that executor. LA with will annexed is a fallback when the testator's chosen executors cannot serve, not a requirement when some renounce but others remain.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no requirement for beneficiary consent when one of multiple executors proceeds alone after another renounces. Beneficiaries do not control who administers the estate - the testator makes that choice by appointing executors in the will. When an executor is validly appointed and willing to act, probate is granted to that executor without needing beneficiary approval. Beneficiaries have rights to ensure proper administration (they can challenge the executor's actions, seek removal for misconduct under s 32 PAA, etc.), but they do not have a veto over which validly appointed executor acts. If beneficiary consent were required, this would undermine the testator's testamentary freedom to choose executors. The answer invents a non-existent requirement. The only consent-related provisions in probate are for dispensing with sureties in LA cases (where adult beneficiaries must consent), but that does not apply here (this is probate, not LA)."

My trustees shall hold my Residuary Trust Fund for Wilson Boh but if Wilson Boh shall predecease me then to Wilson Boh's children in equal shares.\" In the above example a trust is needed because minor interests (being Wilson's children as the alternate beneficiaries/gift over beneficiaries) may arise if the primary beneficiary (Wilson) dies before the testator.' The concern is not Wilson's age at the testator's death (Wilson is 18, nearly an adult), but rather the fact that IF Wilson had predeceased the testator, the gift would go to Wilson's children - who might be minors. Even though Wilson did not predecease (so the gift goes to Wilson), the will needed to be drafted contemplating that possibility. If Wilson were a minor at death, he could take absolutely without a trust. But because the gift-over creates the possibility of Wilson's children (who might be very young) taking, the trust structure protects those potential minor beneficiaries by having trustees manage the property until they reach majority.",

Trusts are used when: (1) beneficiaries are minors who cannot manage property, (2) the testator wants to impose conditions or control how property is used, (3) there are life interests followed by remainders, or (4) there are contingent interests that might arise. Here, the trust is used because of the gift-over provision creating potential minor interests, not because residuary estates inherently require trusts. The answer incorrectly suggests a blanket rule requiring trusts for all residuary estates.",

While it is true that minors (below 21) cannot give good receipt for property and trustees can manage property for minors, Wilson is 18 when the testator dies - close to majority. More importantly, the notes specifically state: 'a trust is needed because minor interests (being Wilson's children as the alternate beneficiaries/gift over beneficiaries) may arise if the primary beneficiary (Wilson) dies before the testator.' The concern is not Wilson's minority per se, but the gift-over to Wilson's children. If the will had no gift-over and simply gave the residue to Wilson absolutely, Wilson could take at 18 (or even at 15) with the executors/trustees managing until he reached 21. But because the will includes 'if Wilson shall predecease me then to Wilson's children,' the testator had to contemplate that Wilson's children (who might be very young) could take. The trust structure protects those potential minor beneficiaries.",

The notes explain that the residuary estate is given 'to my trustees on trust for sale with power to postpone sale' - this is a trust for sale with a power to postpone. A trust for sale means the trustees hold property with a duty to sell it (converting it to cash), but the power to postpone allows them to delay sale if that is in the beneficiaries' interests (e.g., waiting for better market conditions). This power is granted to trustees within an existing trust structure. The reason for creating the trust in the first place (according to the notes) is 'because minor interests... may arise if the primary beneficiary (Wilson) dies before the testator.' The power to postpone is a useful trustee power, but it is not the reason the trust exists.

The subject-matter of the gift is disposed of or destroyed, e.g. shares sold (Low Gim Har, [58a]).' Here, the testator gave a specific devise of 'my property at 15 Newton Road.' This is a gift of that specific property. When the testator sold the Newton Road property before death, the subject-matter of the gift was disposed of. At the testator's death, the Newton Road property is no longer in the estate. Therefore, the gift adeems - it fails completely. Robert receives nothing. The doctrine of ademption is strict: when specifically identified property is disposed of before death, the gift fails, even if the testator purchases replacement property. The Orchard Boulevard property is a different property, not covered by the will's description 'my property at 15 Newton Road.' Robert has no claim to the Orchard property, even though the testator might have used proceeds from selling Newton Road to purchase it. The notes confirm: 'Subsequent conveyance does not prevent operation of the will (WA s 18)... THIS MEANS THE WILL REMAINS VALID EVEN IF AN ASSET TO BE DISTRIBUTED UNDER IT WAS DISPOSED OF... HOWEVER, THE PERSON TO HAVE RECEIVED IT WOULD JUST NO LONGER RECEIVE IT - ADEMPTION.'",

When a specific gift adeems (because the property was sold), the beneficiary receives nothing - there is no doctrine of 'replacement property' that gives the beneficiary whatever the testator purchased with the sale proceeds. The Orchard Boulevard property is a different property from the Newton Road property. The will specifically devised '15 Newton Road,' not 'any property I own at death' or 'property of equivalent value.' If the testator wanted Robert to receive whichever property the testator owned at death, the will would need broader language like 'my primary residence' or 'my real property.' With the specific address, the gift is limited to that property. When it was sold, the gift adeemed. The testator could have avoided this by executing a codicil or new will changing the gift to '20 Orchard Boulevard,' but without such action, Robert receives nothing.",

The notes explain the policy: when specific property is disposed of before death, 'the testator is presumed to have intended the gift not to take effect.' By selling the Newton Road property, the testator is treated as implicitly revoking that gift. What the testator did with the sale proceeds (kept them as cash, spent them, used them to buy other property) is irrelevant - Robert's gift was of the Newton Road property, not cash. If the sale proceeds remain in the estate as cash, they form part of the residuary estate (or pass by intestacy if no residuary clause), not Robert's gift. If the testator wanted Robert to receive the proceeds if the property were sold, the will would need language like 'my property at 15 Newton Road, or if sold, the proceeds thereof.' Without such language, ademption operates strictly.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because executors have no power to substitute equivalent value property for adeemed gifts. When a gift adeems, it simply fails - there is no mechanism for the executor to provide compensation or equivalent property. Executors must administer the estate according to the will's terms, not according to what they think the testator might have wanted. If the will gives specific property and that property is gone, the executor cannot invent a substitute. The executor's duty is to distribute existing estate assets according to the will's provisions, not to create new dispositions. If Robert received nothing due to ademption but the executor gave him equivalent value property, the executor would be breaching fiduciary duties and could be liable to the rightful beneficiaries of that property.

This provides contemporaneous evidence that the testator knew and approved of the will's contents despite the language barrier.

When the testator cannot read or understand English, courts need assurance that the will's contents were properly communicated to the testator and that the testator understood and approved them. The notes list 'Attestation clauses variations (where testator is unable to sign, or cannot understand English, or signs with a non-English language, or is blind)' - these variations are not optional niceties but important evidence of proper execution in special circumstances. Furthermore, under FJR r 215, 'If Registrar wants to satisfy himself as to: (1) execution of will by blind/illiterate testator (2) terms, conditions and date of execution of will... he can require affidavit from any person.' Using the proper attestation clause avoids the need for such affidavits.",

The notes show that wills for non-English-speaking testators are contemplated and valid, provided proper procedures are followed (translation before execution, special attestation recording the translation and testator's understanding). The attestation clause should state that the testator cannot understand English (as a fact), but this does not make the will 'voidable' - rather, it explains why translation was necessary and provides evidence that proper steps were taken. If anything, recording the testator's language limitation and the translation process strengthens the will's validity by showing that appropriate care was taken to ensure the testator's understanding.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because interpretation during instruction-taking is separate from translation at execution. The instruction-taking stage (where the solicitor learns what the testator wants) may involve an interpreter helping the testator communicate with the solicitor.

The notes from Chee Mu Lin Muriel emphasize that 'proving that the terms of the will were read to or explained to the testator is the best way to show that the testator understood the terms of the will' (Lian Kok Hong at [72]). For non-English-speaking testators, this requires translation of the will at execution so the testator knows what is in the document being signed. The special attestation clause records this critical step. Simply having an interpreter at the instruction stage is insufficient - the testator needs to understand the final executed document. The attestation clause provides evidence that the will was translated and the testator understood it, which is essential for proving knowledge and approval."

The court held: 'Precatory words or expression of desire is unenforceable, e.g. \"wish and strong desire\"' (Lau Tyng Tyng at [16]). Precatory words express hopes or preferences but do not create legally binding obligations or trusts. Here, the clause states 'I wish and strongly desire' - these are classic precatory words. The testator is expressing a hope that Emily and Frank will behave prudently, but this is not a legal obligation. Emily receives her $500,000 absolutely (not on trust), and can spend it as she wishes. The testator gave the money to Emily outright. If the testator wanted to impose binding restrictions, the testator should have created an express trust (e.g., 'I give $500,000 to my trustees to hold on trust for Emily, with Emily to receive income only until age 30, then capital') or imposed valid conditions (though conditions restraining alienation are often void).

If precatory words could create binding obligations, testators could impose restrictions through informal language without using proper trust structures or clear conditional language. The law requires clarity when testators want to impose restrictions. To create a binding 10-year restriction on alienation, the will would need clear language like 'I give $500,000 to Emily on condition that she not sell or dispose of it for 10 years' (though even this might be void as a restraint on alienation). The phrase 'I wish and strongly desire' is aspirational, not obligatory. Emily can ignore the wish without legal consequences.

The court held: 'It was extremely unlikely that the testator had intended by the word \"entrust\" to create an actual trust when the shares... had already been gifted to the beneficiaries absolutely under cl 3... Such a trust would contradict cl 3. As cl 3 was unambiguous, cl 4 ought to be construed in a manner that was harmonious with cl 3.' Here, similarly, Emily received $500,000 absolutely. The precatory clause about the testator's 'wish and strong desire' cannot create a trust when the gift is absolute. Extrinsic evidence might show the testator wished Emily would be prudent, but wishes are not trusts. To create a trust requires clear language indicating: (1) trust property, (2) trustees, (3) beneficiaries, and (4) trust terms. Saying 'I wish Emily would not spend the money for 10 years' does not create these elements. The answer incorrectly suggests extrinsic evidence could convert precatory words into a trust.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no constructive trust arising from a beneficiary's failure to comply with a testator's non-binding wishes. Constructive trusts arise in specific circumstances such as: (1) common intention constructive trust (parties have common intention about beneficial interests and detrimental reliance), (2) remedial constructive trust (to prevent unjust enrichment), or (3) breach of fiduciary duty. Emily receiving her $500,000 gift absolutely and spending it does not fit any of these categories. She received the money as a beneficiary under the will - this is not unjust enrichment, there is no common intention constructive trust (the gift was absolute, not based on an agreement about future use), and Emily owes no fiduciary duties (she is a beneficiary, not a trustee or executor). Simply violating the testator's non-binding wish does not create a constructive trust. If it did, every precatory clause would effectively become binding through the backdoor. The answer invents a constructive trust with no legal basis."

The notes explain: '(for a specific gift) If beneficiary dies before testator, the specific gift (e.g. car) lapses and falls into residue (WA s 20).' The spouse's death is a change in circumstances, but the notes are clear that this does not revoke the will: 'Altered circumstances (s 14 WA)... e.g. when person executing the will he was married, but when he died he was divorced. Divorce is an altered circumstance but it does NOT invalidate the will' and 'No will shall be revoked by any presumption of an intention on the ground of an alteration in circumstances (WA s 14).' The same principle applies when a beneficiary (the spouse) dies before the testator. The will remains fully valid, but the gift to the spouse lapses because the spouse predeceased. Where does the lapsed gift go? The notes state it 'falls into residue.' If the residuary gift is also to the spouse, then that failed residue passes by intestacy. Here, the residue is to the wife (but she's dead), so the entire failed gift would pass by intestacy to the testator's next of kin (likely the children). The gifts to the children remain effective. The notes confirm: 'prudent thing for client is to review their will and execute a new one when they have a material change in circumstances (e.g. birth of new child)' - but this is practical advice, not a legal requirement.",

If even divorce (a significant change) does not revoke a will, the death of a beneficiary certainly does not. Section 15 WA sets out the exclusive methods of revocation: (1) marriage (s 13), (2) another will/codicil, (3) writing declaring intention to revoke, or (4) destruction with intent to revoke. A beneficiary's death is not among these methods. The will remains valid; only the specific gift to the deceased beneficiary is affected (it lapses). The answer incorrectly treats the beneficiary's death as revoking the entire will.",
          "C": "This answer is conceptually confused about how lapse works. When a gift to a predeceased beneficiary lapses, this is not 'partial revocation' of the will. Revocation under s 15 WA refers to the testator's intentional act of canceling the will or part of it. Lapse is different - it is the automatic failure of a gift when the beneficiary is not alive to receive it. The will itself is not revoked (partially or wholly). Rather, the will remains fully valid, but one gift cannot take effect because the beneficiary is dead. The notes state: 'If beneficiary dies before testator, the specific gift... lapses and falls into residue.' This is an operation of law upon the gift, not revocation of the will. The rest of the will 'remains valid' not because it avoided partial revocation, but because only the specific gift to the deceased spouse is affected by lapse. The answer uses incorrect terminology suggesting revocation when the issue is lapse.",

The notes state: 'prudent thing for client is to review their will and execute a new one when they have a material change in circumstances (e.g. birth of new child)' - but this is practical advice about estate planning best practices, not a legal requirement for validity. Many wills remain unrevised for years after changed circumstances (beneficiaries dying, new children being born, property being sold, marriages or divorces occurring). These wills remain valid; the law simply applies default rules to handle the changed circumstances (lapse, ademption, partial intestacy, etc.). Here, the will is valid. The fact that the testator did not update it after the spouse's death is unfortunate (might not reflect current intentions) but does not invalidate the will.

When the will specifies that executors must act jointly, this means the executors who are acting must act together (all must agree to each decision).

The notes explain: 'Executors prima facie can act jointly and severally. An act of one executor can bind the estate and other executors' (Tacplas) - but this default can be varied by the will. Here, the will requires joint action. This means decisions require agreement of all acting executors. With B deceased, the acting executors are A, C, and D - they must act jointly (all three agreeing). There is no rule that joint executors become unable to act when one dies. If all appointed executors had to survive to act jointly, this would make joint executor provisions very fragile - any death would trigger LA with will annexed. Instead, the joint requirement applies to whoever is actually acting. A, C, and D apply for probate together, extract the grant in their names, and must act jointly (unanimous agreement) in administering the estate.",

Here, there are three executors (A, C, D) who can and will appear. The fact that B died does not disqualify the others. Joint action means the acting executors must act together, not that all originally appointed executors must survive. If the will said 'A, B, C, and D must act jointly, and if any of them dies, LA with will annexed must be obtained,' this would be different - but no such language appears. The default interpretation of a joint executor clause is that it requires joint action by those who are acting. Since A, C, and D are alive and willing, they can act jointly.

Here, that means A, C, and D must all agree to decisions - they act jointly among the three of them. The 'joint requirement' is not 'frustrated' by B's death - it simply applies to A, C, and D instead of A, B, C, and D. Frustration of contracts is a doctrine that excuses performance when unforeseen circumstances make performance impossible or radically different from what was contemplated. But B's death does not make joint action impossible - it just means joint action by three executors instead of four. This is not a radical change. A, C, and D can fully comply with the testator's intention of joint decision-making. The answer incorrectly suggests the joint requirement disappears, when it continues to apply.",

If executor deaths invalidated wills, many wills would fail unnecessarily. Here, the will is valid. The death of B is an unfortunate circumstance, but does not affect the will's validity. Three executors (A, C, D) remain alive and can act. The 'joint action' requirement is not impossible - A, C, and D can act jointly. There is no need to challenge the will.

The later will supplements or modifies the earlier will where they are inconsistent, but both are admitted to probate together. Here, the 2015 will disposed of: (1) ABC shares to son, and (2) residue to wife. The 2020 will disposed of: (3) Sunset Avenue house to daughter. These are not inconsistent - they deal with different property. Reading them together: the daughter gets the house (per 2020 will), the son gets the ABC shares (per 2015 will), and the wife gets the residue of whatever remains after these specific gifts (per 2015 will). All three dispositions can be given effect. This interpretation respects the testator's intentions as expressed in both wills. It also follows the presumption that 'effect should be given to every word of the will' (Foo Jee Seng at [17]).

Here, the 2020 will gives the house to the daughter but is otherwise silent. This is not inconsistent with the 2015 will's gift of shares to the son and residue to the wife. Both wills can operate together. Implied revocation occurs only when wills are so inconsistent that giving effect to both is impossible (e.g., both wills give the same property to different people, or both wills dispose of the entire estate leaving nothing for the other).

The house goes to the daughter, the shares go to the son, and the residue (after deducting the house and shares) goes to the wife. There is no inconsistency requiring the court to choose between the wills. Furthermore, even if there were minor inconsistencies, courts would not declare both wills failed and apply intestacy - courts would try to harmonize them, or give precedence to the later will as to the inconsistent provisions while maintaining the rest. Total failure and intestacy is a last resort when it is impossible to determine the testator's intentions. Here, the intentions are clear from reading both wills together.",

A revocation clause is substantive content, not a formal requirement. A will without a revocation clause is perfectly valid - it simply means the will might be read together with earlier wills rather than revoking them. The 2020 will, if properly executed, is valid.

The notes confirm: 'Revocation of wills (s 15 WA): No will or codicil, or any part thereof, shall be revoked otherwise than... (d) by the burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying the will by the testator, or by some person in his presence and by his direction, with the intention of revoking it.' Two elements are required: (1) a physical act of destruction (burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying), and (2) intention to revoke. Here, the testator tore the will into four pieces. This is 'tearing' that satisfies element (1). For element (2), the circumstances suggest intention to revoke: the testator took the will out of the safe (indicating deliberate action, not accident) and tore it (a destructive act). The tearing into pieces is strong evidence of intention to revoke - people do not accidentally tear wills into four pieces. Therefore, both elements are satisfied, and the will was validly revoked. The fact that the pieces can be reassembled and the text remains readable is irrelevant. Section 15(d) does not require that the will be made illegible or that destruction be irreversible - even minor tearing with intent to revoke is sufficient.",

The statute requires 'tearing' with 'intention of revoking it' - both elements are satisfied here. The tearing of the will into four pieces, even if the pieces can be reassembled, constitutes 'tearing' under the statute. The law does not distinguish between reversible and irreversible destruction, or between partial and total destruction. Any tearing with intent to revoke is sufficient. If the rule were that the will must be made illegible, testators could argue that any will torn but still readable was not revoked, which would create uncertainty. The clear rule is that tearing (regardless of degree) with intent to revoke validly revokes. Here, the testator's action of taking the will from the safe and tearing it into four pieces demonstrates both the physical act and the intention. The will is revoked, and the testator died intestate (or with any earlier will, if one existed that was not revoked).",
          "C": "This inverts the analysis. The issue is whether the testator intended TO revoke, not whether the testator intended NOT to revoke. Under s 15(d), revocation requires tearing 'with the intention of revoking it.' The burden is on establishing intention to revoke. Here, the circumstances strongly suggest such intention: (1) deliberate act of taking will from safe, (2) tearing into four pieces (not accidental damage), (3) no evidence of changed mind or accident. These facts support a finding of intent to revoke. If a will is torn, there is a presumption of revocation. The notes reference 'Presumption of revocation by T due to the attempted destruction of the will or due to any other circumstance (R 214)' as a situation where the Registrar may require an affidavit. If someone wanted to admit a torn will, they would bear the burden of rebutting the presumption that it was torn with intent to revoke (perhaps showing accident, or that someone else tore it without the testator's consent). The answer suggests the will is presumptively valid unless revocation-intent is proven, when the reality is that a torn will is presumptively revoked unless the presumption is rebutted.",

If a will is accidentally damaged (e.g., water damage from a flood, mouse nibbling the corner, accidental tearing when moving papers), this does not revoke the will because there is no intention to revoke. Revocation requires both: (1) physical act (burning, tearing, destroying), AND (2) intention to revoke. Both elements must be present. Accidental destruction without intent does not revoke. Conversely, intent to revoke without a physical act does not revoke (e.g., merely thinking 'I want to revoke my will' or saying 'I revoke my will' without destroying it is insufficient - would need a writing declaring intention to revoke executed as a will under s 15(c)). Here, the physical damage (tearing into four pieces) combined with the circumstances (deliberate removal from safe) suggests both elements are present, so revocation is valid.

The sample questions provided by the user include a similar scenario: 'Kenneth's copy of the Will was found amongst his possessions and on the front page, Kenneth had written \"This is revoked!!\" and appended his signature to that sentence.' This is likely the same fact pattern testing knowledge of s 15(c).

Here, the testator signed beneath the revocation statement, but 'the two original witnesses do not sign.' Without witnesses, the revocation is ineffective. The will remains valid. If the testator wanted to revoke the will through a writing, the proper procedure is: (1) write a statement of revocation ('I revoke my will dated...'), (2) sign it, and (3) have two witnesses present who sign in the testator's presence - essentially executing the revocation document as if it were a will.",

These same formalities apply to a writing declaring intention to revoke. Simply writing 'This is revoked!!' and signing is insufficient - the testator's signature must be witnessed. The policy is the same as for wills: formalities prevent fraud and provide reliable evidence.

What matters is not the location but the formalities - the writing must be executed as a will (with witnesses). Writing 'This is revoked!!' on the will itself is a perfectly acceptable location for a revocation statement. In fact, this might be preferable to a separate document (which could get lost or separated from the will). The problem here is not that the statement is on the will itself, but that it was not witnessed.

The brother's death before the testator means there is no appointed executor available to extract probate. However, this does not invalidate the will itself. The will's validity depends on compliance with Wills Act formalities at execution, not on whether the appointed executor survives.

The will's validity depends on compliance with Wills Act formalities (execution, signature, witnesses) at the time the will was made, not on whether the appointed executor survives until the testator's death. The notes explain this under 'Avoiding a partial intestacy': 'Partial intestacy can arise in 2 situations: 1. Where a will does not name executors or where all executors have predeceased the testator and the will does not name any substitute executor. In such cases, a grant of letters of administration with will annexed (instead of grant of probate) has to be applied for (s 13 PAA).' Note that this describes partial intestacy (as to executorship) requiring LA with will annexed, not total invalidity of the will. The will remains valid for its dispositive provisions (who gets what property) - only the executorship appointment fails. This is addressed by LA with will annexed, not by invalidating the will.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because a substitute executor is not required for the will's validity. Substitute executors are recommended as good estate planning practice (the notes advise 'Substitutional appointment of executor and trustee is advisable, as having only 1 named executor/trustee is risky since he may predecease the testator or choose to renounce his office'), but their absence does not invalidate the will. If a substitute was appointed and is available, that substitute can apply for probate. But if no substitute was appointed (or the substitute also predeceased), the will remains valid and LA with will annexed is the solution. Section 13 PAA specifically provides for this situation - it would be unnecessary if substitute executors were required. Many wills do not appoint substitutes, and these wills are perfectly valid. When the appointed executor(s) cannot act, s 13 provides a statutory scheme (LA with will annexed to designated classes of persons) rather than invalidating the will.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the absence of an executor does not cause intestacy. The notes distinguish between (1) invalidity of the will (which would cause total intestacy), and (2) failure of executors (which causes partial intestacy as to executorship). The quote states: 'Partial intestacy can arise... where a will does not name executors or where all executors have predeceased the testator and the will does not name any substitute executor.' Partial intestacy means part of the administration (the grant mechanism) follows intestacy procedures (LA instead of probate), but the distribution still follows the will. Here, the will's dispositive provisions (estate to two sons) remain effective. The estate does not 'pass by intestacy' - it passes according to the will (to the sons). Only the method of obtaining the grant changes (LA with will annexed instead of probate). The answer confuses partial intestacy (procedure) with total intestacy (distribution)."

(c) such person or persons, being beneficiaries under the will, as would have been entitled to a grant of letters of administration if the deceased had died intestate...' Steven and Stanley are beneficiaries under the will. Section 6(2) PAA provides: 'if there is a minor (below 21) who is a beneficiary or a life interest under the deceased's estate, need at least 2 administrators for the estate.' George is a two-year-old (a minor beneficiary - he takes Doreen's one-third share under s 26 WA or if the will provides for it). Therefore, at least two administrators are required. Steven and Stanley must apply together. However, there is no requirement for George's guardian's consent. The guardian's role is to protect George's interests during administration, but consent is not needed for the grant application itself. The notes on dispensing sureties mention 'consent in writing of all adult beneficiaries' but George is a minor, so his consent is not obtained.",

The notes distinguish: 'Only one (1) executor is required' (for probate) versus 'At least two (2) administrators must be appointed (s 6 PAA), if there is a minor (below 21) or a life interest under the will' (for LA). Here, George is a two-year-old beneficiary (he takes Doreen's share). Section 6(2) PAA mandates at least two administrators when there is a minor beneficiary. Therefore, Steven and Stanley must apply together - neither can apply alone. Furthermore, the grant type is wrong: probate goes to appointed executors, but Harold (the executor) is dead, so LA with will annexed under s 13 is required.",

George (Doreen's two-year-old son) is a minor who takes a share of the estate (either under s 26 WA if Doreen is treated as having predeceased slightly before the testator, or under the will's distribution). Because George is a minor beneficiary, at least two administrators must apply. Steven and Stanley must both apply together. The answer correctly identifies LA with will annexed but incorrectly suggests one administrator is sufficient when a minor beneficiary exists.",

Steven and Stanley must both apply for LA with will annexed (correct), and George is indeed a minor beneficiary requiring two administrators (correct). However, there is no requirement for the guardian's consent to the grant application. The notes mention consent requirements in the context of dispensing with sureties: 'An application to dispense with sureties is made by summons supported by an affidavit... it must contain the consent in writing of all adult beneficiaries.' This refers to adult beneficiaries consenting to dispense with sureties, not to the grant itself. George's guardian has a role in protecting George's interests and might be involved in decisions about George's share, but does not need to consent to the grant application. The administrators (Steven and Stanley) will apply for the grant, and if sureties are required (due to George being a minor), they might seek dispensation with adult beneficiaries' consent (Steven and Stanley's own consent), but not George's guardian's consent."

Section 6 contemplates that testators may be unable to sign personally (due to blindness, physical disability, illiteracy, or other reasons) and allows signing 'by some other person in his presence and by his direction.' Here, the testator's friend signed the testator's name while the testator watched ('in the testator's presence') and presumably at the testator's direction. If these requirements are met, the signature is valid. The two witnesses then signed, satisfying the witness requirement. There is no restriction on who can sign on behalf of the testator - it can be a friend, relative, solicitor, or anyone, as long as it is done in the testator's presence and by his direction.

If personal signature were mandatory, such persons could never make valid wills, which would be unfair and impractical. Section 6(2) provides: the testator must sign 'or by some other person in his presence and by his direction.' This is not 'delegation' in the general sense - it is a specific statutory accommodation for testators unable to sign personally. The key safeguards are: (1) the signing must be in the testator's presence (the testator must witness it), and (2) it must be by the testator's direction (not someone else's initiative). Here, both requirements appear satisfied - the friend signed 'while the testator watches' and presumably at the testator's instruction.

This could be anyone - a friend (as here), family member, solicitor, witness, or stranger - as long as the signing is done 'in his presence and by his direction.' There is no requirement for a 'qualified person' like a notary public or authorized official. The policy is to accommodate testators who cannot sign personally, not to create bureaucratic hurdles. The safeguards are the presence and direction requirements (ensuring the testator controls the signing) and the witness requirement (providing independent evidence of proper execution). If special qualifications were required, this would make it difficult for disabled testators to execute wills, especially in urgent situations.

The friend's signature (at the testator's direction in his presence) constitutes the testator's signature for legal purposes. No additional mark by the testator is required. A testator might choose to add a thumbprint or mark as additional evidence of authorization, but this is not legally required. Indeed, if the testator could make a mark, the testator might simply make the mark as his signature (marks and thumbprints can be valid signatures). But if the testator cannot make any mark (complete paralysis of hands), having someone else sign is sufficient. The answer incorrectly requires an additional act beyond what s 6(2) mandates."

The will controls distribution, not the ISA. The notes explain: 'No hotchpotch rule: inter vivos advancements by deceased (i.e. gifts when he was alive) to children/descendants of children must be ignored in calculating distributive share (s 9 ISA).' This rule applies only to intestate estates. For testate estates (with wills), the will's terms control. Here, the will gives equal shares to the three children. Unless the will itself addresses inter vivos gifts (e.g., 'my estate to my three children in equal shares, after taking into account any advances made during my lifetime'), the will is applied as written. Each child receives one-third of the estate at death, regardless of what they received during the testator's lifetime. The $500,000 gift is simply a lifetime gift that does not affect the testamentary distribution. This is an advantage of having a will - the testator can make lifetime gifts without affecting testamentary shares (unless the will says otherwise).",

This is the opposite of a hotchpot rule. Under common law historically, some jurisdictions had hotchpot rules requiring lifetime advances to children to be brought back into account when calculating intestate shares. Singapore explicitly rejected this through s 9 ISA - lifetime gifts are ignored. But more fundamentally, this rule only applies to intestate estates. Here, the testator died testate (with a will), so ISA does not govern distribution at all. The answer is doubly wrong: it invents a hotchpot rule that doesn't exist, and applies ISA to a testate estate.",

Section 9 ISA provides that 'inter vivos advancements by deceased... to children/descendants of children must be ignored in calculating distributive share' - but this is a rule for calculating shares under ISA intestate distribution. When a person dies testate (with a will), ISA does not govern distribution. The notes explain ISA's scope: 'Property of intestate to be distributed (s 5 ISA): If a person dies intestate... that property... shall be distributed among the persons entitled to succeed beneficially...' and the distribution follows the s 7 rules. But the testator here died testate, not intestate. The will governs distribution, not ISA. The answer correctly identifies what s 9 says, but misapplies it to a testate estate. If the testator had died intestate, then s 9 would apply and the $500,000 gift would be ignored. But since there's a will, ISA is irrelevant.",

Without such language in the will, lifetime gifts are separate from testamentary gifts. Here, the will simply gives equal shares with no reference to lifetime gifts. Therefore, each child receives one-third regardless of the $500,000. The answer suggests that the gift must be 'expressly stated' to be an advancement, but this is backwards - if anything, the will would need to expressly state that lifetime gifts should be accounted for (and even then, the will's terms would control, not some external advancement doctrine)."

When ABC Company acquired XYZ Company and the shares were converted, the XYZ shares ceased to exist. At the testator's death, there are no XYZ shares in the estate - only ABC shares. Since the gift was specifically of XYZ shares, and those shares no longer conform to their description, the gift adeems. The nephew receives nothing. This might seem harsh - economically, the ABC shares may represent the same value or even more value than the XYZ shares. But legally, they are different property. The will gave XYZ shares, not 'shares of equivalent value' or 'my shares in XYZ Company or any successor company.'

If the testator wanted the nephew to receive whatever shares resulted from corporate transactions, the will would need language like 'my shares in XYZ Company and any shares issued in exchange thereof' or 'my shareholding in XYZ Company however constituted.'

While it might seem economically fair for the nephew to receive the ABC shares (as the converted replacement), the law of ademption is strict: the gift was of XYZ shares, and those shares no longer exist, so the gift fails. The ABC shares are different property. They may have resulted from converting XYZ shares, but they are shares in a different company. The will did not give 'my shares however constituted after corporate transactions' - it gave 'my shares in XYZ Company.' Low Gim Har at [58b] specifically identifies this scenario as causing ademption: when X company is taken over by Y company and shares in Y are issued in exchange for shares in X, the gift of X shares adeems. If the law allowed automatic substitution of converted shares, the doctrine of ademption would be significantly eroded. The answer incorrectly treats ABC shares as automatic replacements for XYZ shares.",

Ademption is a strict doctrine based on the specific description of the gifted property. If the property does not exist at death in the form described, the gift fails - regardless of whether economically equivalent property exists. The notes from Low Gim Har list three scenarios for ademption, including when property 'ceases to conform to its description' - this focuses on the description in the will, not economic substance. The will describes the gift as 'shares in XYZ Company.' At death, those shares do not exist. ABC shares, even if economically equivalent or even more valuable, do not 'conform to the description' of XYZ shares. They are shares in a different company. The answer's test ('if the conversion maintained the economic substance') would introduce uncertainty and litigation - who determines 'economic substance'? What if ABC shares are worth more or less than XYZ shares were? The law avoids these problems through the clear rule: specific property not conforming to its description means ademption.

This gift-over clause shows the testator's intention and displaces the default lapse rule.

The testator has expressly stated what should happen if a child predeceases without issue - the share goes to surviving children, not to the deceased child's estate. Furthermore, s 26 would not help here anyway. Section 26 prevents lapse when a child predeceases 'leaving issue' (children). Y died 'without leaving issue' - Y has no children. Section 26 only operates when the deceased child has issue to take the gift. Since Y has no issue, s 26 would not apply even if there were no gift-over. The gift would lapse.

This is a clear direction that if Y dies without children (which happened), Y's share goes to 'my surviving children' (X and Z).

So the $50,000 is distributed under ISA s 7 rules (to spouse, children, parents, etc., depending on who survives). The notes further state: 'The executor is deemed to be the trustee for person entitled to the residue on intestacy and should simply apply for grant of probate of the will without needing a separate letter of administration, notwithstanding the partial intestacy (CLA s 24).' So the executor handles distribution but follows ISA rules for the undisposed $50,000.",

          "A": "This is incorrect because undisposed assets do not automatically follow the will's distribution scheme for other assets. Each gift in a will is specific - it disposes of particular property to particular beneficiaries. If the will gives 'my house to my son' and 'my car to my daughter,' the son does not automatically receive a share of other undisposed assets like bank accounts. The will's distributions apply only to the property expressly mentioned. For property not mentioned, the will is silent. The notes state: 'Assets specifically disposed will be done so according to the terms of the will, but: Undisposed assets will be accorded to persons who take upon the intestacy of the testator, according to intestate rules (s 10 ISA).' There is a clear distinction between disposed and undisposed assets. The $50,000 bank account, not mentioned in the will, is undisposed and passes by intestacy. It does not automatically go to beneficiaries named in the will for other assets.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because equal distribution among named beneficiaries is not the rule for partial intestacy. This answer suggests a kind of implied residuary clause where undisposed property goes equally to all beneficiaries. But the law does not imply such a clause. The notes are clear: undisposed property passes 'according to intestate rules (s 10 ISA).' The beneficiaries under intestacy rules (ISA s 7) may or may not be the same as the beneficiaries under the will. For example, if the will gives everything to the testator's friend, but the testator has a surviving spouse and children, the undisposed $50,000 would go to the spouse and children under ISA, not to the friend. Even if the will's beneficiaries happen to be the same people who take under intestacy, the shares might differ (ISA has specific percentage allocations that may differ from the will's provisions). The answer invents an equal distribution rule that does not exist.",
          "D": "This is incorrect in suggesting the executor personally receives the undisposed assets. Executors are fiduciaries who hold estate property for the benefit of the rightful beneficiaries, not for themselves. Section 24 Civil Law Act provides: 'Executor deemed to be trustee for person entitled to residue on intestacy (CLA s 24).' The notes explain: 'The executor is deemed to be the trustee for person entitled to the residue on intestacy and should simply apply for grant of probate of the will without needing a separate letter of administration, notwithstanding the partial intestacy.' This means the executor holds the undisposed $50,000 as trustee for whoever is entitled under intestacy rules - the intestate beneficiaries under ISA s 7. The executor does not receive the money personally (unless the executor happens to also be an intestate beneficiary, which is not indicated here). The answer confuses the executor's role as trustee/administrator with beneficial entitlement."

Section 13 Wills Act provides that wills are revoked by marriage 'unless... expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage.' The notes state: '[Will revoked by marriage unless \"expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage\" (WA s 13)].' Here, the will contains express language: 'made in contemplation of my marriage to Jane Doe scheduled for next month.' This satisfies the s 13 exception. The will expressly states it is made contemplating the marriage to Jane that is about to occur. When that marriage actually happens one month later, the will is not revoked because it falls within the s 13 exception. The key elements are: (1) the will must express that it is made in contemplation of a marriage (not merely that the testator is contemplating marriage, but that the will itself is made with that marriage in mind), and (2) the marriage contemplated must actually occur. Both are satisfied here. The will remains fully operative after the marriage, governing distribution of the testator's estate when he dies two years later.",

          "A": "This is incorrect because s 13 Wills Act contains an exception for wills 'expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage.' The default rule is that marriage revokes wills (to force testators to reconsider dispositions after marriage), but if the testator anticipated the marriage and made the will with that marriage in mind, the will should not be revoked. Here, the will expressly states it is 'made in contemplation of my marriage to Jane Doe scheduled for next month.' This is precisely the type of language that satisfies the s 13 exception. The testator knew marriage was imminent, considered its implications, and executed the will with that marriage in mind. When the marriage occurred, it did not revoke the will because the will was already made contemplating that marriage. The answer applies the default rule (marriage revokes) without considering the exception (contemplation of marriage clause).",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 13 Wills Act operates on an all-or-nothing basis - either the marriage revokes the entire will, or it does not revoke the will at all (if the exception applies). There is no partial revocation where some gifts survive and others are revoked. The notes do not suggest any such partial revocation mechanism. If the marriage revokes the will, the entire will is revoked (the testator dies intestate unless there is an earlier will that was not revoked). If the exception applies (will made in contemplation of marriage), the entire will remains valid. Here, because the will was expressly made in contemplation of the marriage to Jane, the s 13 exception applies, and the entire will remains valid - all gifts, whether to Jane or to others, remain effective. The answer invents a partial revocation rule that does not exist in s 13.",

Section 13 Wills Act sets out the conditions for avoiding revocation: the will must be 'expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage.' This is a requirement about the will's contents (what it says), not about the spouse's post-marriage consent. If the statutory language in the will satisfies s 13 (as it does here), the will remains valid automatically when that marriage occurs. The spouse's views are irrelevant. This makes sense - testamentary freedom means the testator decides how to dispose of property, not the spouse. If spousal consent were required, this would give spouses a veto over testamentary dispositions, which would undermine testamentary freedom. The will here remains valid based on its express contemplation language, regardless of whether Jane likes the will's terms or consents to its operation."

Assets specifically disposed will be done so according to the terms of the will, but: Undisposed assets will be accorded to persons who take upon the intestacy of the testator, according to intestate rules (s 10 ISA).' The residuary estate typically bears debts and expenses first before specific gifts are touched. Here, the $200,000 bank account is undisposed (not mentioned in the will) and forms the 'residue' for purposes of paying debts. The $50,000 in debts is paid from this $200,000, leaving $150,000. This $150,000 remaining is still undisposed by the will (no residuary clause), so it passes by intestacy under s 10 ISA and s 7 distribution rules. The specific gifts of jewelry and property go to their designated beneficiaries as stated in the will without reduction (assuming the $150,000 is sufficient to satisfy them after debt payment). If debts exceeded $200,000, then specific gifts might need to be abated, but here the undisposed assets are sufficient to cover debts with surplus remaining.",

The notes state: 'Undisposed assets will be accorded to persons who take upon the intestacy of the testator, according to intestate rules (s 10 ISA).' The will disposes only of jewelry and property - the $200,000 bank account is not disposed of by the will. Therefore, it cannot pass 'under the will.' It must pass by intestacy. Furthermore, the order of abatement typically has debts and expenses paid from the residuary estate first before specific gifts are abated. Here, the undisposed $200,000 effectively functions as the residuary estate (though passing by intestacy, not under the will). Debts should be paid from this $200,000 first. Only if this were insufficient would specific gifts be abated. Since $200,000 is more than enough to pay $50,000 in debts, the specific gifts are unaffected. The answer incorrectly suggests specific gifts should be abated when sufficient undisposed assets exist to pay debts.",

The notes distinguish between partial and total intestacy: 'Partial intestacy can arise... where a will does not dispose of some part of the testator's estate.' Partial intestacy means some assets pass under the will (those specifically disposed of) and some pass by intestacy (those undisposed of). The will remains valid for the assets it does dispose of. Here, the specific gifts of jewelry and property pass according to the will's terms to the designated beneficiaries. Only the undisposed $200,000 (after paying debts) passes by intestacy. If failure to dispose of all assets caused total intestacy, this would penalize testators for omissions and frustrate their intentions regarding the property they did dispose of. The law seeks to give effect to wills to the maximum extent possible. The answer incorrectly treats partial intestacy as total intestacy.",

        "correct": "The most relevant issue is whether the testator received independent legal advice about the gift. Rule 25 Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 provides that when a lawyer receives a significant gift from a client, the lawyer '(a) must not act for the client in relation to the gift; and (b) must advise the client to obtain independent legal advice in relation to the gift.' The notes reference 'Gifts from clients (PCR r 25)' in the context of conflict of interest. Here, the Solicitor who drafted the will is also a beneficiary receiving $50,000. This creates a clear conflict: the Solicitor is advising the testator about a will that benefits the Solicitor. The Solicitor should have: (1) not acted for the testator in relation to the gift clause, (2) advised the testator to obtain independent legal advice about whether to make this gift, and (3) ideally, had another solicitor draft the gift clause or the entire will. The notes from Low Ah Cheow at [74] emphasize: 'The solicitor should also conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation where a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist. The solicitor must be nothing less than a completely independent adviser.' A solicitor drafting a will that benefits the solicitor is the paradigm conflict of interest. If the Solicitor did not ensure independent advice, the gift is highly vulnerable to challenge.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "While testamentary capacity is always relevant to a will's validity, it is not the MOST relevant issue in this specific scenario involving a gift to the drafting solicitor. The notes from Chee Mu Lin Muriel establish that testamentary capacity creates a rebuttable presumption of knowledge and approval, 'UNLESS: there were circumstances surrounding the execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will (or some provision in it) did not express the mind of the testator' (at [46]). The notes give an example at [48]: 'where a will was prepared by a person who takes a substantial benefit under it, or who has procured its execution...' This describes exactly the situation here - the Solicitor prepared the will and takes a $50,000 benefit. This raises well-grounded suspicion that shifts the burden. Even if the testator had testamentary capacity generally, the specific gift to the Solicitor is suspicious. The key issue is not general capacity, but whether this specific gift resulted from the Solicitor's influence or lack of independent advice, implicating professional conduct rules and knowledge/approval of this provision.",
          "C": "While the proportionality of the gift to services rendered might be relevant to assessing whether the gift is 'significant' under Rule 25 PCR or whether it suggests undue influence, it is not the most relevant issue. Even a small gift from a client to the drafting solicitor raises conflict of interest concerns. Rule 25 PCR does not set a threshold where gifts below a certain value are permissible - it refers to 'significant gift' but in the context of a $50,000 gift and a will-drafting relationship, this would almost certainly be considered significant. The notes from Lee Suet Fern state there was 'clear conflict of interest regardless of whether LKY's last will increased, decreased or maintained LHY's share who was the husband of the solicitor' - showing that the amount or proportionality is not determinative of the conflict. The conflict exists because of the relationship (solicitor-client) and the benefit (gift), not because of the size of the gift relative to services. The answer focuses on proportionality when the key issue is the conflict and lack of independent advice.",
          "D": "This answer discusses undue influence, which is a relevant but distinct issue from the conflict of interest under Rule 25 PCR. Undue influence is a substantive ground for invalidating a will or gift (the testator's will was overborne). The solicitor-client relationship is a fiduciary relationship that can give rise to a presumption of undue influence. However, the notes focus on the professional conduct dimension: the Solicitor's duty under Rule 25 to advise the client to get independent advice. The issue is not just whether undue influence occurred, but whether proper procedures were followed. Even if there was no actual undue influence (the testator genuinely wanted to benefit the Solicitor), the failure to advise the testator to get independent legal advice is a professional conduct breach that makes the gift vulnerable. The answer is not wrong, but focusing on independent legal advice (answer B) is more directly relevant to the professional conduct standards emphasized in the notes."

The notes explain: 'How to renounce: (a) orally at hearing of probate application or (2) in writing in Form 53(a) attested by solicitor (s 3(2) PAA).' Once the brother renounces (acknowledging he is unable to act), the niece becomes entitled to apply for probate as the substitute executor. The notes state: 'Substitutional appointment of executor and trustee is advisable, as having only 1 named executor/trustee is risky since he may predecease the testator or choose to renounce his office.' The testator wisely included such a provision. The niece steps into the brother's position and can obtain probate in her own name as the substitute executor appointed in the will.

The brother has been appointed as primary executor and has the first right to the grant. The brother is 'unable to act' due to illness, which triggers the substitution clause, but procedurally, the brother must renounce or fail to apply before the niece can act. If the brother does not renounce, the niece might need to use citation procedures to force the issue.

The testator anticipated the possibility that the brother might be unable to act and appointed the niece as substitute for precisely this situation. Once the brother renounces (or is determined unable to act), the niece can apply for probate as the appointed substitute executor.

If the brother is 'severely ill and unable to act,' he cannot apply for probate. Application for probate requires the executor to sign the Originating Summons, supporting affidavit, administration oath, and other documents. If the brother is too ill to do this, he cannot apply. Furthermore, executorship is a personal office that cannot be delegated. The notes from Tacplas Property Services address how executors act (jointly or severally), but there is no provision for delegation to non-executors. An executor can appoint agents to help with specific tasks (e.g., solicitors to handle legal work, accountants for accounts), but cannot delegate the executorship itself to another person. The substitute executor mechanism exists precisely because executorship cannot be delegated. The testator appointed the niece as substitute, not as delegate.

The notes explain: 'Ambulatory nature of wills: will \"to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will\" (WA s 19) - i.e. upon death of testator. Can be changed as often as testator wants to during his lifetime, provided he has testamentary capacity to do so.' When a will refers to 'my children' as a class, this is interpreted as of the testator's death, not execution. At death, the testator has three children - all three are included in the class 'my children.' The ambulatory principle means the will is read as if executed immediately before death, capturing the testator's family situation at death. Unless the will shows 'contrary intention' (e.g., 'my two children, John and Mary' - naming specific children), class gifts like 'my children' include all children alive at death, even those born after the will was executed.",

The will is construed 'as if it had been executed immediately before the death of a testator' - this means class descriptions like 'my children' are determined as of death, not execution. If the rule were that only children alive at execution count, this would create harsh results: testators who have children after executing wills would need to execute new wills or codicils after each birth to include the new children. This would be impractical and contrary to most testators' intentions. When a testator gives property to 'my children,' the normal assumption is that all the testator's children should benefit, whenever they were born. The ambulatory principle gives effect to this assumption. If the testator wanted to limit the gift to children alive at execution, the will would need clear language showing this contrary intention (e.g., 'my children alive on the date of this will' or naming specific children).",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the burden of proof is reversed. The default rule under s 19 WA is that 'my children' includes all children alive at death (ambulatory principle). The burden is on someone arguing for a contrary interpretation to prove 'contrary intention' in the will. Here, there is no contrary intention - the will simply says 'my children' without limitation. The third child does not need to prove the testator intended to include after-born children - that is the default assumption. Someone wanting to exclude the third child would need to prove contrary intention (e.g., evidence that the testator knew about the pregnancy but deliberately chose not to amend the will, or specific language limiting the class). Without such evidence, all three children share equally. The answer incorrectly places the burden on the third child to prove inclusion when inclusion is the default.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because express language about future children is not required - this is the default under the ambulatory principle. Section 19 WA makes wills speak as of death unless there is contrary intention. For class gifts like 'my children,' this automatically includes children born after the will but before death. Express language would be needed for the opposite result - to exclude after-born children. For example, if the will said 'my two children currently alive' or 'my children born as of the date of this will,' this would be contrary intention excluding future children. The default rule includes them. The answer inverts the requirement, suggesting express inclusion is needed when the law presumes inclusion absent express exclusion."

Beatrice died before the testator, but left issue (one child) who is alive at the testator's death. Therefore, s 26 applies: Beatrice's gift does not lapse, but takes effect as if Beatrice died immediately after the testator. This creates a fiction that Beatrice survived just long enough to inherit her one-third, then died, passing it to her child (the testator's grandchild). Result: Anne gets one-third, Catherine gets one-third, Beatrice's child gets one-third.",

          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores s 26 Wills Act, which prevents lapse when the testator's child who is a named beneficiary predeceases leaving issue. The notes state: 'If testator's named child/children is/are a beneficiary, and the named child predeceases testator, gift goes to deceased child's estate for distribution, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will (s 26 Wills Act).' Wait - the notes say 'deceased child's estate' but that is a simplification. The actual operation of s 26 is that the gift 'take effect as if the death of that person had happened immediately after the death of the testator' - creating a legal fiction that the child survived to inherit, then immediately died. The practical effect is that the child's issue (children) receive the share, not that it goes to the child's estate generally (which might include a spouse or other beneficiaries). Here, Beatrice has one child. That child receives Beatrice's one-third share. The share does not lapse into intestacy as the answer suggests. Section 26 specifically prevents lapse when the deceased beneficiary is the testator's child who left issue.",
          "C": "This is a reasonable interpretation of what s 26 might mean, but it is not quite accurate. The notes state: 'gift goes to deceased child's estate for distribution, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will (s 26 Wills Act).' This suggests the gift goes to Beatrice's estate. However, the actual operation of s 26 is more specific: it creates a fiction that Beatrice died 'immediately after the death of the testator.' This typically means Beatrice's issue (her child) takes, not her estate generally. The distinction matters if Beatrice had a spouse - if the gift goes to 'Beatrice's estate,' the spouse might have a claim under ISA. But s 26's fiction that the child survived to inherit, then died, typically benefits the child's issue directly. The answer is closer than the others but may not capture the full effect of s 26. The better view is that Beatrice's child receives the one-third directly, not through Beatrice's estate.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because this is NOT a class gift - the daughters are named individually. The notes distinguish: 'S 26 WA does NOT apply to a class gift (Loke Soh Lui, [21])' versus 'Naming each child by name is not a class gift and will be covered by s 26 (Loke Soh Lui, [17]), e.g. \"to John, Paul, Jogee and Sarah\".' Here, the will says 'my three daughters, Anne, Beatrice, and Catherine' - each is named. This is not a class gift. If the will said 'my daughters' or 'my children,' that would be a class gift, and the answer's analysis would be correct (Beatrice's share would redistribute to Anne and Catherine). But because the daughters are named, this is covered by s 26, not the class gift lapse rules. Section 26 prevents lapse when a named child predeceases leaving issue - Beatrice's child receives Beatrice's share. The answer incorrectly treats this as a class gift."
