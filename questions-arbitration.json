What is the Singapore court's position on enforcing an award that has been set aside at the seat?",
    "options": [
      "A. The Singapore court will always enforce the award regardless of whether it has been set aside at the seat, as the Singapore court conducts its own independent review of the award's validity.",
      "B. The Singapore court will not enforce an award that has been set aside at the seat, as the effect of a setting aside is that there is no award left to enforce. However, the court retains residual discretion to order enforcement even if a refusal ground is established.",

      "correct": "**Option B (CORRECT):** Under Art V(1)(e) NYC and s31(2)(f) IAA, an award may be refused enforcement on the ground that it has been set aside or suspended by a competent court at the seat of arbitration. The SGCA has indicated in dicta that the Singapore court will not enforce an award that has been set aside at the seat - the effect of a setting aside is that there is no award left to enforce. However, under Art V(1) NYC, enforcement 'may be refused' (not 'must be refused'), giving the court residual discretion. Some jurisdictions (like the US) have taken a different approach, but Singapore follows the position that a setting aside at the seat generally prevents enforcement. **Option A (INCORRECT):** The Singapore court does not always enforce awards set aside at the seat. The general position is that setting aside at the seat prevents enforcement. **Option C (INCORRECT):** The Singapore court does not distinguish between procedural and substantive grounds for setting aside when considering enforcement. If the award is set aside at the seat, enforcement will generally be refused. **Option D (INCORRECT):** Adjournment is not automatic. Under MAN Diesel v Turbo SE, the enforcement court has discretion to adjourn, considering factors like the merits of the setting aside application, likely consequences of adjournment, and other relevant factors.",

Under Darius, the party must show that if the breach did not occur, it could have reasonably made a difference to the outcome. **Statement II (CORRECT):** In Soh Beng Tee v Fairmount [2007] SGCA 28, the court held that awards should be read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the rules of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately remedied. The court will not scrutinize an award to find defects in process. **Statement III (CORRECT):** In China Machine v Jaguar Energy [2020] 1 SLR 695, the court held that if a party intends to contend that there has been a fatal failure in the process, it must give fair intimation to the tribunal and cannot simply reserve its position until after the award.

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** Under s31(4)(b) IAA and Art V(2)(b) NYC, a court may refuse enforcement if enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of the country where enforcement is sought. The court may raise these grounds on its own initiative (unlike the grounds under s31(2) which must be proven by the award debtor). **Statement II (CORRECT):** In Singapore, the scope of public policy is narrow. In PT Asuransi v Dexia Bank [2006] SGCA 41, the court held that public policy only operates in instances where upholding the arbitral award would 'shock the conscience' or is 'clearly injurious to the public good' or 'wholly offensive to the ordinary, reasonable and fully informed member of the public' or 'where it violates the forum's most basic notion of morality and justice'. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Public policy can be contested on the basis that the underlying contract is illegal or tainted with illegality (most common ground). However, ordinarily the tribunal would already have dealt with the legality of the underlying contract. The question is to what extent the court should reopen that issue of illegality. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Under AJU v AJT [2011] SGCA 41, the SGCA appears to have held that only errors of law made by the tribunal as to the content of the forum's public policy is subject to re-opening by that forum, but not otherwise. An interpretation of AJU v AJT in VBX v CBZ suggests: where underlying contract is Singapore law and the tribunal finds it not illegal, the court can reopen; where underlying contract is foreign law and the tribunal finds it not illegal, the court should only reopen where there is 'palpable and indisputable illegality'; in all other cases, unable to intervene. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** The court will not always refuse enforcement if there is illegality. The court considers the extent to which it should reopen the tribunal's determination, and in some cases (especially where foreign law governs), the court will only reopen where there is 'palpable and indisputable illegality'.",

This is the prima facie approach adopted in Malini v Ventura [2015] SGHC 225, because this is properly a matter within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal (Tomolugen v Silica Investors [2015] 1 SLR 373). **Statement II (CORRECT):** Under the SGCA definitive 3-condition test in Tomolugen, the court should grant stay of court proceedings (i.e. favor arbitration) if the applicant shows prima facie that: (a) there is a valid arbitration agreement between the parties to the court proceedings; (b) the dispute in the court proceedings (or any part thereof) falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement; and (c) the arbitration agreement is not null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. **Statement III (CORRECT):** The court will reach a definitive ruling (cf prima facie finding) only where it is clear that the dispute is outside the terms of the arbitration or that a party is not a party to the arbitration agreement or that the application is out of time (Dalian Hualiang Enterprise v Louis Dreyfus Asia [2005] SGHC 161 at [21]). **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Where it is merely arguable that the dispute falls within the terms of the arbitration agreement or that a party to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement, a stay of proceedings should be granted so that the matters can be determined by the arbitral tribunal (Dalian Hualiang v Louis Dreyfus at [21]). **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Singapore law does NOT follow English law in this regard.

It would expose the counterparty to potential contempt of court proceedings before the Singapore courts (especially if the counterparty likes to travel to Singapore). **Statement II (CORRECT):** Anti-suit injunctions are controversial because they interfere with the jurisdiction of the foreign court, going against international comity. Because a court's actions may simply be ignored by a foreign court, the success of the anti-suit injunction depends on the amount of coercive power a court can bring to bear over the party subject to its jurisdiction. **Statement III (CORRECT):** In Singapore, the threshold for granting an ASI is quite low. ASI should be granted in aid of arbitration proceedings as long as 2 conditions are fulfilled: (a) there is a valid and binding arbitration agreement pursuant to s2A IAA; and (b) there is evidence that a contracting party has acted in breach of the arbitration agreement by commencing proceedings elsewhere. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Under Maldives Airports Co Ltd v GMR Male International Airport Pte Ltd [2013] 2 SLR 449, the SGCA accepted the English Court of Appeal's holding in Aggeliki Charis Compania Maritama SA v Pagnan SpA, The Angelic Grace [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 87 at 96 that there should be 'no good reason for diffidence in granting an injunction to restrain foreign proceedings on the clear and simple ground that the defendant has promised not to bring them.' **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Anti-suit injunctions ARE granted in Singapore.

It is not automatically invalid just because the main contract is invalid. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Under COT v COU [2023] SGCA 31, the SGCA held that the separability principle only applies to questions of CONTRACTUAL VALIDITY, and not CONTRACTUAL FORMATION. As such, when the complaint goes towards whether the contract is even formed in the first place, separability does not apply and a party can dispute that the entire contract (including the arbitration clause) was not properly formed. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Practically speaking, if one wants to challenge the validity of the arbitration clause, one cannot simply allege the invalidity of the entire contract - the challenge needs to be targeted at the arbitration clause. This doctrine of separability has been applied by the courts in Singapore (Govt. of Philippines v Philippine International Air Terminals [2006] SGHC 206). **Statement V (INCORRECT):** The separability doctrine does NOT mean that the arbitration clause is always valid even if the main contract was never formed.

However, note that setting aside applications can still be made if they are based on other grounds in Art 34 MAL which are not based on jurisdiction objections. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Nevertheless, subject to any waiver, an award debtor always retains its rights to resist enforcement of the award wherever the award creditor may try to enforce the award: PT First Media v Astro Nusantara [2013] SGCA 57. This is because enforcement resistance is in a different basket of 'passive' remedies, separate from the 'active' remedies of appeal and setting aside. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** If the tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction in an award that also deals with the merits of the case, s10(3) IAA is not triggered since it only covers appeals on rulings of jurisdiction (preliminary decisions). Instead, the objecting party can apply to set aside the award under Art 34 MAL, or resist enforcement of the award wherever the award creditor may try to enforce the award under s31 IAA and Art 36 MAL. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** A party who does not appeal under s10(3) IAA does NOT lose all rights to challenge jurisdiction forever.

An interim measure may not be enforceable internationally under the NYC and may need to be requested directly from a court at the place of execution. If the interim relief sought would ultimately require court assistance, such as the attachment of a bank account, going to court immediately would save time. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Under s12A(1)(b) IAA, the court can order interim measures whether or not the seat of arbitration is Singapore. This overruled Swift-Fortune v Magnifica [2006] SGCA 42, which had held that the court could only grant interim measures if the seat was Singapore. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Under s12A(2) IAA, the court has the power to make an order of any of the matters set out in s12(1)(c) to (i) IAA. These include: (d) preservation of property; (e) samples and observations; (f) preservation of evidence; (g) securing the amount in dispute; (h) ensuring award is not rendered ineffectual; and (i) interim injunctions. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Under s12A(4) IAA, if it is urgent, the SGHC may make such orders as it thinks necessary for the purpose of preserving evidence or assets. Under s12A(5) IAA, if it is not urgent, the SGHC will only grant interim relief if the application is made with the permission of the arbitral tribunal or the agreement in writing of the other parties. In every case, the SGHC will make an order only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal or institution has no power, or is unable for the time being to act effectively under s12A(6) IAA. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** The court will NOT always grant interim relief. The court has discretion and must consider various factors. Under s12A(3) IAA, the SGHC may refuse to make an order if the fact that the seat is outside Singapore or likely to be outside Singapore makes it inappropriate.

Wait for the counterparty to bring enforcement proceedings in whatever jurisdiction, then resist enforcement of the award in that jurisdiction (the passive approach). These are the two primary ways to challenge an unfavorable award. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Setting aside and resisting enforcement are cumulative options. You can choose to do either or both. The fact that the award debtor chooses not to apply to set aside the award does not preclude him from resisting enforcement of the award, and the converse is true as well. Parties can pursue both remedies simultaneously or sequentially. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Assuming the seat of arbitration is Singapore, Art 1(2) MAL prescribes that an Art 34 MAL setting aside application must take place in Singapore, and it must be made before the Singapore High Court, the court specified in the IAA for the purposes of Art 6 MAL. Setting aside must be done at the seat. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** A court may not set aside a foreign award - the setting aside application must be made at the seat. Wait until enforcement action is taken by the award creditor, then resist enforcement in that jurisdiction. Likely that the laws of that jurisdiction would mirror the NYC since most states are signatory to the NYC. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** A party CAN choose both approaches. Setting aside and resisting enforcement are NOT mutually exclusive - they are cumulative options. A party can apply to set aside at the seat AND resist enforcement in jurisdictions where enforcement is sought. They serve different purposes and can be pursued together.",

Apart from these grounds, a court has no power to investigate the merits of the dispute. Errors of law or fact made in an arbitral decision are final and binding on the parties and may not be appealed against or set aside by a court (PT Asuransi v Dexia Bank). **Statement II (CORRECT):** Art 34(2)(a) MAL - the party making the application furnishes proof that: (i) a party to the arbitration agreement was under some incapacity; or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of this state; or (ii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceeding or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (iii) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; or (iv) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this law from which the parties cannot derogate. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Art 34(2)(b) MAL - the court finds that (the court may raise these grounds on its own initiative): (i) The subject matter of this dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of this state; or (ii) the award is in conflict with the public policy of this state. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Additional grounds under s24 IAA: (a) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; (b) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced. These are Singapore-specific grounds beyond the Model Law. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** A setting aside application CANNOT be made at any time. Under Art 34(3) MAL, the setting aside application must be made within 3 months from the date on which the party making that application received the award. The Singapore courts have no discretion to extend the time period.

Vary parts of the award. Remit the award to the arbitral tribunal for reconsideration. Refuse to set aside the award (even despite the applicant having established one or more grounds). The court has multiple options for relief. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Under Art 34(4) MAL, the court, when asked to set aside an award, may, where appropriate and so requested by a party, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of time in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the arbitral tribunal's opinion will eliminate the grounds for setting aside.

These are the main ways to challenge on public policy grounds. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** On the 2nd point - underlying contract tainted with illegality: Ordinarily, the tribunal would already have dealt with the legality of the underlying contract. The question is to what extent the court should reopen that issue of illegality. SGCA in AJU v AJT [2011] SGCA 41 appears to have held that only errors of law made by the tribunal as to the content of the forum's public policy is subject to re-opening by that forum, but not otherwise. An interpretation of AJU v AJT in VBX v CBZ: Where underlying contract is Singapore law and the tribunal finds it not illegal, the court can reopen.

Likely consequences occasioned by an adjournment, notably the length of the adjournment. Any other relevant factors. Note that the court has a wide discretion. The court considers all relevant circumstances. **Statement IV (INCORRECT):** The court will NOT always automatically adjourn enforcement proceedings. Adjournment is NOT automatic - it is discretionary. The court must consider the merits of the setting aside application, the length of adjournment, and other factors. The court has wide discretion and may refuse to adjourn if the setting aside application appears weak or if adjournment would cause undue delay. **Statement V (CORRECT):** Even if a refusal ground is established, the court still has a residual discretion to order enforcement.

Under Art 12(2) MAL, an arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to 'justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence, or if he does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties'. The duty to disclose is ongoing. **Statement II (CORRECT):** However, under Art 12(2) MAL, a party may challenge an arbitrator nominated by him only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment was made. A party cannot challenge an arbitrator they nominated based on information they knew at the time of nomination - this prevents parties from nominating someone and then challenging them based on known circumstances. **Statement III (CORRECT):** An objection must be made as soon as the grounds are known to the party seeking the challenge. Failure to do so may constitute a waiver under Art 4 MAL. Parties must raise challenges promptly, not wait until after an unfavorable award. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Test for impartiality and independence. Types of bias possible: Actual bias - obviously will disqualify the arbitrator. Imputed bias - also certain disqualification. Arises where a judge or arbitrator may be said to be acting in his own cause (nemo judex in sua causa) and this happens if he has, for instance, a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the case. In such a case, disqualification is certain without the need to investigate whether there is a likelihood or even suspicion of bias. Apparent bias - apply the 'reasonable suspicion' test. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** A party CANNOT challenge an arbitrator they nominated based on reasons they knew at the time of nomination. Under Art 12(2) MAL, a party may challenge an arbitrator nominated by him only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment was made.

The seat of arbitration is important because: (1) you choose the court with supervisory powers; (2) it determines the lex arbitri (e.g. if Singapore is seat, Singapore law applies - AA for domestic parties, IAA if foreign element present); and (3) only the seat court can set aside the award (no other court can set aside, though enforcement can be resisted elsewhere).",

These elements ensure the clause is effective. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Other important elements include: certainty as to number of arbitrators - avoid having a panel of two arbitrators; stipulate the language of proceedings; stipulate the governing law of the arbitration agreement (governs the validity of the arbitration clause, cf lex arbitri which governs the procedural conduct of the arbitration); and stipulate to what extent parties agree to go for expedited arbitration (which is a feature available under certain institutional rules). **Statement III (CORRECT):** Certainty of the seat of arbitration is crucial because: (1) you choose the court with supervisory powers over the conduct of the arbitration; (2) the law that governs the procedural conduct of the arbitration (lex arbitri) - e.g. if Singapore is the seat, Singapore law applies, [if domestic parties] Arbitration Act applies, [if foreign element present] International Arbitration Act; and (3) once an arbitration award is produced by the tribunal, only the seat court has the power to set aside or annul the award (no other court in the world can set aside). Cf application for resisting enforcement of award, which can occur in any other country. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Lex arbitri (e.g. IAA in Singapore) will give effect to the rules picked by parties (e.g. SIAC rules) unless those rules conflict with a mandatory provision of the lex arbitri - s15A Singapore's IAA. Guidelines and Best Practices do not have the force of law, but are frequently used instruments (IBA Guidelines and Rules). **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Drafting arbitration clauses IS important.

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** SG court's review of tribunal's decision on its own jurisdiction (either as a preliminary issue under s10(3) IAA or at setting aside stage after award is released) - standard is de novo and is not bound by the tribunal's decision. Courts review jurisdiction decisions independently, not deferentially. **Statement II (CORRECT):** SG court's deference to tribunal - only for issues relating to procedure. The court will NOT grant deference to tribunal on issues of jurisdiction - it will be reviewed de novo (i.e. point 1 above). Courts defer on procedure but not on jurisdiction. **Statement III (CORRECT):** When determining if grounds for refusing enforcement of award are satisfied, the court will undertake a fresh examination of the issues alleged - standard is de novo. If court finds that the tribunal ascertained the seat of arbitration wrongly, it is akin to a jurisdictional defect so the court will interfere and not allow enforcement of the award (ST Group v Sanum Investments). Enforcement review is also de novo. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** For application of stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration, SG court will only conduct a prima facie examination of whether a dispute subject to the arbitration agreement exists and whether there is a valid and binding arbitration agreement between parties. SG court would only consider the existence, scope and validity of the arbitration agreement on a prima facie basis (cf definitive ruling based on balance of probabilities). Stay applications use a lower threshold. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Singapore courts do NOT always defer to tribunal decisions. Courts review jurisdiction decisions de novo (not deferentially). Courts only defer on procedural matters, not on jurisdiction. The standard of review varies depending on the issue - de novo for jurisdiction, deferential for procedure, prima facie for stay applications.",

      "I. If a party wants to object to the tribunal's jurisdiction, he must do so before the submission of the statement of defence under Art 16(2) MAL - failure to raise jurisdictional objections in time may result in waiver.",
      "II. If a party wants to apply for stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration, it must be done before the submission of the first statement in court on the substance of the dispute under Art 8(1) MAL - filing a statement on the merits waives the right to stay.",
      "III. Application to set aside award must be done within 3 months of receiving the award under Art 34(3) MAL - NO EXTENSIONS! Singapore courts have said that the deadline is absolute, even if fraud is alleged.",
      "IV. The reason for the absolute 3-month deadline for setting aside is apparently because if you miss the deadline for setting aside, you can still resist enforcement of the award anyway, so there is an alternative remedy.",

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** If a party wants to object to the tribunal's jurisdiction, he must do so before the submission of the statement of defence (Art 16(2) MAL). Failure to raise jurisdictional objections in time may result in waiver under Art 4 MAL. Parties must raise jurisdictional objections promptly. **Statement II (CORRECT):** If a party wants to apply for stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration, it must be done before the submission of the first statement in court on the substance of the dispute (Art 8(1) MAL). Filing a statement on the merits waives the right to stay. Parties must apply for stay before engaging with the substance of the dispute in court. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Application to set aside award must be done within 3 months of receiving the award - NO EXTENSIONS! (Art 34(3) MAL). Singapore courts have said that the deadline is absolute, even if fraud is alleged. The deadline is strict and cannot be extended. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** The reason for the absolute 3-month deadline for setting aside is apparently because if you miss the deadline for setting aside, you can still resist enforcement of the award anyway, so there is an alternative remedy. This explains why the deadline is so strict - parties have another avenue to challenge the award. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** There ARE time limits for arbitration applications. Jurisdictional objections must be raised before the statement of defence. Stay applications must be made before the first statement on the merits. Setting aside applications must be made within 3 months. These time limits are important and failure to comply can result in waiver or loss of rights.",

      "III. If the claim arises BECAUSE of the insolvency regime (e.g. undue preference) or arises because of the onset of the insolvency regime, then it is NOT arbitrable - these claims are inherently part of the insolvency process and must be determined by the court.",
      "IV. The distinction is important because arbitrable claims can be resolved through arbitration, while non-arbitrable claims must be resolved through the insolvency court process.",

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** For corporate insolvency issues under IRDA - it may or may not be arbitrable, depending on the SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE of the dispute (Larsen). The key question is whether the claim relates to a pre-insolvency claim or arises because of the insolvency regime. The arbitrability depends on the nature of the claim. **Statement II (CORRECT):** If the claim relates to a pre-insolvency claim, it is arbitrable. These are claims that existed before the insolvency and are not dependent on the insolvency regime. Pre-insolvency contractual or commercial claims can be arbitrated. **Statement III (CORRECT):** If the claim arises BECAUSE of the insolvency regime (e.g. undue preference) or arises because of the onset of the insolvency regime, then it is NOT arbitrable. These claims are inherently part of the insolvency process and must be determined by the court. Insolvency-specific claims like avoidance actions are not arbitrable. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** The distinction is important because arbitrable claims can be resolved through arbitration, while non-arbitrable claims must be resolved through the insolvency court process. Understanding this distinction helps parties determine the appropriate forum. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** NOT all corporate insolvency disputes are automatically arbitrable. Claims that arise because of the insolvency regime (like undue preference, transactions at undervalue, etc.) are NOT arbitrable. Only pre-insolvency claims are arbitrable. There are restrictions based on the nature of the claim.",
