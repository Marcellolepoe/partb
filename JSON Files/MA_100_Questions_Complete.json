    "question": "TechStart Pte Ltd (a private company) is acquiring InnovateCorp Pte Ltd (a public company) for S$50 million. The acquisition will be structured as a share purchase, and TechStart plans to finance the acquisition through a combination of: (1) S$20 million from its own cash reserves, (2) S$25 million from a bank loan secured against InnovateCorp's assets, and (3) S$5 million from InnovateCorp's cash reserves (which InnovateCorp will lend to TechStart). The company's legal advisor is assessing the transaction structure. Which of the following statements about the legal issues may apply?",
    "statements": [
      "I. The S$25 million bank loan secured against InnovateCorp's assets violates section 76 of the Companies Act as it constitutes financial assistance.",
      "II. The S$5 million loan from InnovateCorp to TechStart violates section 76 as it constitutes financial assistance for the acquisition of InnovateCorp's own shares.",
      "III. The transaction structure is permissible as InnovateCorp is a public company and section 76 only applies to private companies.",
      "IV. The bank loan is permissible as it is secured against InnovateCorp's assets but not provided by InnovateCorp itself.",
      "V. The transaction requires shareholder approval under section 160 as it involves the disposal of substantially the whole of InnovateCorp's property."
    ],
    "options": [
      "A. II and IV only",
      "B. I, II and V only",
      "C. II, III and IV only",
      "D. All of the above"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "**Statement I (INCORRECT):** The bank loan secured against InnovateCorp's assets is not financial assistance as it's not provided by InnovateCorp itself. **Statement II (CORRECT):** The S$5 million loan from InnovateCorp to TechStart violates section 76 as it constitutes financial assistance for the acquisition of InnovateCorp's own shares. **Statement III (INCORRECT):** Section 76 applies to public companies and their subsidiaries, not private companies. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** The bank loan is permissible as it's provided by a third party (the bank) and secured against InnovateCorp's assets, not provided by InnovateCorp itself. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Section 160 applies to disposal of company property, not acquisition of shares.",
    "detailed_explanation": "### Understanding Financial Assistance Under Section 76 Companies Act\n\n**What this question is testing:** This question tests your understanding of the financial assistance prohibition under section 76 of the Companies Act, including what constitutes financial assistance and to which companies it applies.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n*   **Section 76(1) CA:** Public companies and their subsidiaries cannot give financial assistance for the acquisition of their own shares.\n*   **Section 76(2) CA:** Financial assistance includes loans, guarantees, provision of security, release of obligations, etc.\n*   **Scope:** Only applies to public companies and their subsidiaries, not private companies.\n*   **Third-party assistance:** Financial assistance provided by third parties (like banks) is not prohibited.\n*   **Section 160 CA:** Requires shareholder approval for disposal of substantially the whole of company's property.\n\n**Why each statement is correct or wrong:**\n\n*   **I. The S$25 million bank loan secured against InnovateCorp's assets violates section 76 as it constitutes financial assistance.**\n    *   **INCORRECT.** This is a red herring. The bank loan is provided by a third party (the bank), not by InnovateCorp itself. Section 76 only prohibits financial assistance given by the company whose shares are being acquired, not by third parties.\n\n*   **II. The S$5 million loan from InnovateCorp to TechStart violates section 76 as it constitutes financial assistance for the acquisition of InnovateCorp's own shares.**\n    *   **CORRECT.** This is a clear violation of section 76. InnovateCorp (a public company) is providing financial assistance (a loan) to TechStart for the acquisition of InnovateCorp's own shares. This is exactly what section 76 prohibits.\n\n*   **III. The transaction structure is permissible as InnovateCorp is a public company and section 76 only applies to private companies.**\n    *   **INCORRECT.** This is a common exam trap. Section 76 applies to public companies and their subsidiaries, not private companies. The statement has the rule backwards.\n\n*   **IV. The bank loan is permissible as it is secured against InnovateCorp's assets but not provided by InnovateCorp itself.**\n    *   **CORRECT.** The bank loan is provided by a third party (the bank) and is secured against InnovateCorp's assets. This is permissible as it's not financial assistance provided by InnovateCorp itself.\n\n*   **V. The transaction requires shareholder approval under section 160 as it involves the disposal of substantially the whole of InnovateCorp's property.**\n    *   **INCORRECT.** Section 160 applies to disposal of company property, not acquisition of shares. This is a share purchase transaction, not an asset disposal.\n\n**Exam Tips:** Remember that section 76 only applies to public companies and their subsidiaries, and only prohibits financial assistance provided by the company whose shares are being acquired. Third-party assistance is not prohibited. Section 160 applies to disposal of company property, not acquisition of shares.",
