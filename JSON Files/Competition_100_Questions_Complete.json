    "question": "Five major supermarket chains in Singapore (Chain A, B, C, D, and E) have been under investigation by the CCCS for potential anti-competitive conduct. The investigation revealed that: (1) Chain A and B agreed to fix the price of fresh chicken at S$8.50 per kg, (2) Chain C attended meetings with A and B but claims it never implemented the agreed prices, (3) Chain D received price information from Chain A but did not respond, and (4) Chain E independently raised its prices to S$8.50 per kg after seeing the others' prices. The CCCS is determining liability under section 34 of the Competition Act. Which of the following statements about liability may apply?",
    "statements": [
      "I. Only Chain A and B are liable as they were the only ones who explicitly agreed to fix prices.",
      "II. Chain C is liable as it attended the meetings and is presumed to have participated in the concerted practice.",
      "III. Chain D is liable as it received price information from Chain A, creating a presumption of concerted practice.",
      "IV. Chain E is not liable as it acted independently without any communication with other chains.",
      "V. All chains except Chain E are liable as they were all part of the same anti-competitive arrangement."
    ],
    "options": [
      "A. II, III and V only",
      "B. I, II and III only",
      "C. II, III and IV only",
      "D. All of the above"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "**Statement I (INCORRECT):** This oversimplifies the law. Liability under section 34 extends beyond explicit agreements to include concerted practices. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Chain C is liable as attending meetings creates a presumption of participation in concerted practice under the Anic presumption. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Chain D is liable as receiving price information creates a presumption of concerted practice, even without reciprocal exchange. **Statement IV (INCORRECT):** Chain E's independent action doesn't create liability, but the statement is wrong about the overall liability assessment. **Statement V (CORRECT):** Chains A, B, C, and D are all liable as they were part of the same anti-competitive arrangement through agreements and concerted practices.",
    "detailed_explanation": "### Understanding Section 34 Liability for Anti-competitive Agreements and Concerted Practices\n\n**What this question is testing:** This question tests your understanding of the broad scope of section 34 liability, including both explicit agreements and concerted practices, and the presumptions that apply in competition law.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n*   **Section 34 CA:** Prohibits agreements, decisions, and concerted practices that have the object or effect of preventing, restricting, or distorting competition.\n*   **Concerted practice:** Knowingly substituting the risks of competition for practical cooperation between undertakings.\n*   **Anic presumption:** Market actors are presumed to use information exchanged with competitors when determining their market conduct.\n*   **One-way information exchange:** Even one-way provision of information can create liability.\n*   **Independent action:** Acting independently without communication does not create liability.\n\n**Why each statement is correct or wrong:**\n\n*   **I. Only Chain A and B are liable as they were the only ones who explicitly agreed to fix prices.**\n    *   **INCORRECT.** This is a red herring that oversimplifies section 34 liability. The prohibition extends to concerted practices, not just explicit agreements. Chain C's attendance at meetings and Chain D's receipt of price information can create liability even without explicit agreement.\n\n*   **II. Chain C is liable as it attended the meetings and is presumed to have participated in the concerted practice.**\n    *   **CORRECT.** Under the Anic presumption, attending meetings where anti-competitive information is exchanged creates a presumption that the party used that information in determining their market conduct, making them liable for concerted practice.\n\n*   **III. Chain D is liable as it received price information from Chain A, creating a presumption of concerted practice.**\n    *   **CORRECT.** Even one-way provision of information can create liability under the Anic presumption. The CCCS has held that mere receipt of price information raises the presumption that the recipient's future behavior would not be independent.\n\n*   **IV. Chain E is not liable as it acted independently without any communication with other chains.**\n    *   **INCORRECT.** While Chain E's independent action doesn't create liability, this statement is wrong about the overall liability assessment. The question asks about liability generally, not just Chain E's liability.\n\n*   **V. All chains except Chain E are liable as they were all part of the same anti-competitive arrangement.**\n    *   **CORRECT.** Chains A, B, C, and D are all liable through different mechanisms: A and B through explicit agreement, C through participation in meetings, and D through receipt of price information. Chain E acted independently and is not liable.\n\n**Exam Tips:** Remember that section 34 liability is broad and includes both explicit agreements and concerted practices. The Anic presumption is crucial for understanding how information exchange creates liability. Independent action without communication does not create liability.",
