Statement V is incorrect - providing security doesn't automatically set aside arrest, it provides an alternative to arrest.",
      "detailed_explanation": "**BASIC CONCEPT: Ship Arrest for Collision Claims**\n\nShip arrest is a powerful remedy in admiralty law that allows claimants to secure their claims by detaining a vessel. Collision claims are one of the most common grounds for ship arrest.\n\n**What this question tests:** Your understanding of the requirements for ship arrest, particularly for collision claims, and the relationship between arrest and security.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n**I. Arrest of Collision-Causing Ship (CORRECT):**\n- **s 3(1)(d) High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act** allows arrest for collision damage\n- The ship that caused the damage can be arrested to secure the claim\n- This is a maritime lien that attaches to the ship itself\n- Ocean Star can be arrested because it caused the collision\n\n**III. Prima Facie Case Required (CORRECT):**\n- **O 70 r 4(1) Rules of Court** requires a prima facie case for arrest\n- Must show reasonable grounds for believing the claim is valid\n- Collision negligence must be established on the evidence\n- This prevents frivolous arrests and protects shipowners\n\n**IV. No Need for Other Assets (CORRECT):**\n- Ship arrest is independent of the shipowner's other assets\n- The ship itself is the security for the claim\n- Maritime liens attach to the ship, not the owner's general assets\n- This is what makes ship arrest so powerful\n\n**Why other statements are wrong:**\n\n**II. Beneficial Ownership Not Required (INCORRECT):**\n- For collision claims, beneficial ownership is not required\n- Maritime liens attach to the ship itself, regardless of ownership\n- This is different from other types of claims where ownership matters\n- The ship can be arrested even if owned by a different entity\n\n**V. Security Doesn't Auto-Set Aside Arrest (INCORRECT):**\n- Providing security doesn't automatically set aside arrest\n- Security provides an alternative to arrest (ship can be released)\n- But the arrest itself remains valid until court orders release\n- Security and arrest are separate legal concepts\n\n**Exam Tips:**\n- Collision claims = maritime liens = ship can be arrested\n- Prima facie case always required for arrest\n- Maritime liens attach to ship, not owner's other assets\n- Security provides alternative to arrest, doesn't invalidate it",

      "question": "CargoCorp Pte Ltd shipped goods worth S$2 million on board the vessel 'Pacific Trader' under a bill of lading. The goods were damaged during the voyage due to the vessel's unseaworthiness. CargoCorp wishes to arrest Pacific Trader to secure its claim for cargo damage. Which of the following statements about the arrest is correct?",
      "statements": [
        "I. CargoCorp can arrest Pacific Trader as the bill of lading creates a maritime lien for cargo damage.",
        "II. The arrest can only proceed if Pacific Trader's owners were the carriers under the bill of lading.",
        "III. CargoCorp must first obtain a judgment against the shipowners before it can arrest the vessel.",
        "IV. The arrest will be set aside if the shipowners provide security in the form of a bank guarantee.",
        "V. CargoCorp can arrest any vessel owned by the same shipowner, not just Pacific Trader."

        "C. I, II and IV only",
        "D. All of the above"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Statements II and IV are correct. Statement II: The shipowners must be the carriers under the bill of lading for arrest to proceed. Statement IV: Providing security (bank guarantee) will result in the arrest being set aside and the ship released. Statement I is incorrect - bill of lading doesn't create maritime liens for cargo damage. Statement III is incorrect - no judgment required before arrest. Statement V is incorrect - can only arrest the specific vessel involved in the claim.",
      "detailed_explanation": "**BASIC CONCEPT: Ship Arrest for Cargo Claims**\n\nCargo claims are common in admiralty practice, but they have different rules from collision claims. Understanding the distinction between maritime liens and statutory rights is crucial.\n\n**What this question tests:** Your understanding of cargo claims, maritime liens vs statutory rights, and the requirements for arresting vessels for cargo damage.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n**II. Shipowners Must Be Carriers (CORRECT):**\n- For cargo claims, the shipowners must be the carriers under the bill of lading\n- This establishes the necessary connection between the claim and the ship\n- If shipowners are not the carriers, arrest cannot proceed\n- This is different from collision claims where the ship itself is liable\n\n**IV. Security Sets Aside Arrest (CORRECT):**\n- **O 70 r 7 Rules of Court** allows shipowners to provide security\n- Bank guarantee is acceptable security for cargo claims\n- Once security is provided, arrest is set aside and ship is released\n- This is the standard procedure in admiralty practice\n\n**Why other statements are wrong:**\n\n**I. No Maritime Lien for Cargo Damage (INCORRECT):**\n- Bill of lading doesn't create maritime liens for cargo damage\n- Cargo claims are statutory rights under **s 3(1)(g) High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act**\n- Maritime liens are limited to specific claims (collision, salvage, wages)\n- This is a fundamental distinction in admiralty law\n\n**III. No Judgment Required (INCORRECT):**\n- Arrest can proceed without a judgment\n- **O 70 r 4(1) Rules of Court** only requires a prima facie case\n- Judgment comes after arrest, not before\n- This is what makes arrest so powerful - it secures claims before judgment\n\n**V. Only Specific Vessel Can Be Arrested (INCORRECT):**\n- Can only arrest the vessel involved in the specific claim\n- **s 3(1)(g)** allows arrest of the ship in connection with which the claim arose\n- Cannot arrest other vessels owned by the same shipowner\n- This is different from general civil enforcement\n\n**Exam Tips:**\n- Cargo claims = statutory rights, not maritime liens\n- Shipowners must be carriers for cargo arrest\n- No judgment required before arrest\n- Can only arrest the specific vessel involved\n- Security sets aside arrest and releases ship",
