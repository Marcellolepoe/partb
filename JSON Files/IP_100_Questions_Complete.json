      "detailed_explanation": "**BASIC CONCEPT: Multi-Layered IP Protection for Software**\n\nSoftware can be protected under multiple IP regimes simultaneously. Each type of protection covers different aspects of the software and provides different benefits.\n\n**What this question tests:** Your understanding of how different IP rights can be used together to provide comprehensive protection for software products.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n**I. Copyright Protection for Code (CORRECT):**\n- **Copyright Act s 7(1)** protects literary works, including computer programs\n- Software code is automatically protected upon creation (no registration required)\n- Protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves\n- Duration: life of author + 70 years or 70 years from publication\n- This is the most common form of software protection\n\n**II. Patent Protection for Algorithms (CORRECT):**\n- **Patents Act s 13** allows patenting of algorithms if they meet requirements:\n  - **Novelty**: Not disclosed anywhere before\n  - **Inventive step**: Not obvious to skilled person\n  - **Industrial applicability**: Can be made or used in industry\n- Algorithms must be technical and solve a technical problem\n- Duration: 20 years from filing date\n- Provides stronger protection than copyright\n\n**III. Copyright Protection for UI Design (CORRECT):**\n- **Copyright Act s 7(1)** protects artistic works, including graphic designs\n- User interface designs are protected as artistic works\n- Protects the visual appearance and layout\n- Separate from copyright in the underlying code\n- Duration: same as literary works\n\n**IV. Trademark Protection for Branding (CORRECT):**\n- **Trade Marks Act s 2** allows registration of distinctive signs\n- Software names and logos can be registered as trademarks\n- Protects brand identity and prevents confusion\n- Must be distinctive and not descriptive\n- Duration: 10 years, renewable indefinitely\n- Provides protection against unauthorized use of brand\n\n**V. Trade Secret Protection (CORRECT):**\n- **Common law** protects confidential information\n- Source code can be protected as trade secret\n- Requirements: information must be secret, have commercial value, reasonable steps to maintain secrecy\n- No registration required, but must maintain confidentiality\n- Duration: indefinite, as long as secrecy maintained\n- Provides protection against reverse engineering\n\n**Exam Tips:**\n- Software can have multiple IP protections simultaneously\n- Copyright = automatic protection for code and design\n- Patents = stronger protection for technical innovations\n- Trademarks = brand protection\n- Trade secrets = confidential information protection\n- Each protection has different requirements and durations",

      "question": "BrandCorp Pte Ltd has been using the trademark 'ECO-FRIENDLY' for its line of environmentally friendly cleaning products since 2018. The company has not registered this trademark.

        "IV. BrandCorp's unregistered rights are limited to the geographical area where it has actually used the mark.",

Statement IV: Unregistered rights are limited to geographical area of use. Statement V: BrandCorp can prevent registration if the mark has acquired distinctiveness. Statement I is incorrect - unregistered trademarks can still have legal protection.",
      "detailed_explanation": "**BASIC CONCEPT: Unregistered Trademark Rights vs Registered Trademark Rights**\n\nTrademark rights can exist even without registration. Understanding the difference between registered and unregistered rights is crucial for IP practice.\n\n**What this question tests:** Your understanding of unregistered trademark rights, opposition procedures, and the geographical limitations of unregistered rights.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n**II. Opposition Based on Prior Use (CORRECT):**\n- **Trade Marks Act s 8(2)** allows opposition based on prior use of identical/similar mark\n- BrandCorp can oppose GreenClean's application within 2 months of publication\n- Must prove prior use and likelihood of confusion\n- This is the main remedy for unregistered trademark owners\n\n**III. Passing Off Action (CORRECT):**\n- **Common law** passing off protects unregistered trademarks\n- Requirements: goodwill, misrepresentation, damage\n- BrandCorp must prove it has built up goodwill in the mark\n- Can seek injunctions and damages against GreenClean\n- This is the traditional remedy for unregistered rights\n\n**IV. Geographical Limitation (CORRECT):**\n- Unregistered rights are limited to areas where mark has been used\n- **Trade Marks Act s 8(2)** requires use in Singapore for opposition\n- BrandCorp's rights only extend to where it has actually used the mark\n- This is different from registered marks which have nationwide protection\n\n**V. Acquired Distinctiveness (CORRECT):**\n- **Trade Marks Act s 7(1)** allows registration of descriptive marks if they acquire distinctiveness\n- If 'ECO-FRIENDLY' has become distinctive through use, BrandCorp can claim rights\n- Must prove the mark has acquired secondary meaning\n- This can prevent GreenClean from registering the mark\n\n**Why Statement I is wrong:**\n\n**I. No Rights Without Registration (INCORRECT):**\n- Unregistered trademarks can still have legal protection\n- **Common law** passing off protects unregistered marks\n- **Trade Marks Act s 8(2)** allows opposition based on prior use\n- Registration provides stronger protection but is not the only form of protection\n\n**Exam Tips:**\n- Unregistered marks can still have legal protection\n- Prior use can be basis for opposition and passing off\n- Unregistered rights are geographically limited\n- Acquired distinctiveness can prevent registration of descriptive marks\n- Registration provides stronger, nationwide protection",
