He is approached by Stelle and Jade, two university students who are each facing several charges of Unlawful Stalking under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014. The alleged victim in all the above charges is Dan, who studies at the same university. Stelle and Jade inform Otto that they had indeed carried out at least some of the acts which they are accused of, including sending Dan hundreds of text messages over a period of two weeks, loitering outside Dan's classroom, loitering outside Dan's university housing, taking hundreds of photographs of Dan, and rummaging through trashcans to collect items discarded by Dan. They explain to Otto that Dan reminds them of a well-known actor from a popular television drama series, and that they meant no harm but only wanted to get to know him better. Jade also informs Otto that she will pay for all legal fees as Stelle has limited financial resources. Otto agrees to act for both Stelle and Jade, and he hands each of them his firm's standard engagement letter, which they sign.",

      "model_answer": "Otto's conduct in agreeing to act for both Stelle and Jade raises several ethical issues under the PCR 2015. The primary concern is Rule 20 - Otto cannot represent both clients if there is a conflict of interest between them. As co-defendants in the same criminal proceedings, Stelle and Jade may have conflicting interests. For example, one may want to blame the other, or their defenses may conflict. Otto should have assessed whether informed consent was possible after full disclosure, but the facts suggest he did not do this. Additionally, while Otto can maintain confidentiality under Rule 6, he may not be able to act competently for both clients under Rule 5 if their interests conflict. The financial arrangement where Jade pays for Stelle's fees also requires careful consideration to ensure Stelle's interests are protected. Otto should have either declined to act for both clients or obtained proper informed consent after full disclosure of the potential conflicts."

Kate has no experience with criminal law, procedure, or evidence, which are essential for handling a complex criminal fraud case. Rule 5(2)(c) requires acting with competence, which Kate cannot do without the necessary expertise. Representing Liam would not be in his best interests under Rule 5(2)(j), as her lack of experience could seriously harm his defense. Kate should decline to act and refer Liam to an experienced criminal defense lawyer. If Kate wants to handle criminal cases in the future, she should first gain the necessary knowledge and skills through training and possibly working with an experienced criminal lawyer."

Mark should immediately file the documents, even if late, and explain the circumstances to the court. He should also apologize for the delay and take steps to ensure it doesn't happen again. Rule 13(5) requires that undertakings should only be given if the lawyer knows they can honor them, so Mark should have been more careful about giving the undertaking. In the future, Mark should only give undertakings when he is certain he can fulfill them, or should have asked for more time initially. The court may impose sanctions for the late filing, but Mark must still honor his undertaking."
