Protection of Personal Data under PDPA 
Weightage: 
- 1/3 on data protection and PDPA, including the cybersecurity provisions of PDPA 
- 1/3 on cybersecurity under PDPA and Cybersecurity Act (CYSA)
- 1/3 on regulation of AI and data processing, and POHA, POFMA (to a lesser extent) and the recent Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2023 (Online Safety Act)
o Just know the key approaches taken, remedies available. And have the Acts on standby at the exam. 
Essential cases to know: 
- Michael Reed v Alex Bellingham (noted below) 
- [2019] SGPDPC3 Singapore Health Services and Integrated Health Information Systems (The SingHealth data breach case – for cybersecurity) (noted below) 
*Part A: Purpose and scope of PDPA 
Background of PDPA:
- PDPA is Singapore’s first general data protection law, enacted in 2012 and came into force in stages up to July 2014. Before PDPA, there were some sectoral regulations for data protection in their sector (e.g. banking)
- PDPA was significantly amended in 2020 to introduce new obligations in line with modern data protection laws in other jurisdictions 
o New provisions on data protection obligations and rights of individuals
o New criminal offences relating to misuse of personal data
o Enhanced enforcement powers of PDPC/Commissioner

PDPC:
- Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) was established in 2013
- PDPC has issued several advisory guidelines (under s 49 PDPA) and other publications and materials to assist organisations in complying with the PDPA, focus on: (1) Key Concepts Guidelines, (2) Selected Topics Guidelines and (3) Enforcement Guidelines
o No legally binding effect of advisory guidelines, but they indicate the manner in which the PDPC will interpret and apply the provisions of the PDPA --> strong indication of how PDPC is going to apply it, so from a compliance POV you should follow the guidelines

Purpose and scope: s 3 PDPA 
- Govern collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations
- Recognizes
o Right of individuals to protect their personal data 
o Needs of organizations to collect and use personal data for appropriate purposes
- Does NOT confer proprietary rights (ownership) over personal data (usual laws apply)
- Key terms: 
o Personal data, individuals (target subject-matter)
o Organisations (entities required to comply)
o Collection, use, disclosure / data processing (target activities)

*DEFINITION OF PERSONAL DATA 
How to interpret “personal data” 
- Broad approach – data is personal data as long as it contains personally identifiable information 
o This approach is pretty much adopted by Parliament and more in line with the scheme of the PDPA. Considerations of reasonableness of practicability are dealt with in the obligations themselves. 
- Warren Chik has consolidated some debate over the “balance of interests” approach vs “broad and expansive” approach – see the banter doc for that

Elements – APPLY THIS (s 2 PDPA)
- “data”
- “whether true or not” --> factual information OR opinions of an individual
- “about an individual”
- “an individual who can be identified”, whether:
o directly from that data or 
o in conjunction with other data which the org has or to which it is likely to have access.

Element 1: Data
- Appears to include information recorded in both electronic and non-electronic form 
- Debate over whether it includes non-recorded information – Warren Chik says it should only include recorded information, since this would be in line with the majority of jurisdictions and in line with global trends 
o There are also quite a few evidentiary difficulties with trying to track non-recorded data 

Element 2: Whether true or not
- Includes false information 
- Expressions of opinion? Possible, since expressions of opinion are typically subjective in nature and can be factually inaccurate to some extent 
o PDPA does not specifically include opinion as a form of personal data, unlike Aus 
o Argument against including expressions of opinion – “opinion or expression” was removed from the PDPA’s adaptation of the Aus DPA’s definition of PD, suggests a deliberate intention not to include it as PD 
o Argument for including expressions of opinion (Warren Chik) – 
* information should be PD as long as it identifies the individual – information about a person’s brand preferences would be personal data whether it comes from the person himself or from an analysis of his spending patterns. 
* It is difficult to separate expressions of fact and opinion about an individual – maintaining a distinction would create a loophole 
* The Act has provisions that refer to opinions (“professional or expert opinion”), and information for an evaluative purpose – suggests that it is possible to deal sensibly with opinions 

Element 3: About an individual 
- PDPC guidance makes clear that “about” is synonymous with “relating to” – broad view taken 

- “Individual” – natural person, whether living or deceased 
o PDPA has limited effect in relation to personal data of deceased individuals (s 4(4)(b) PDPA: This Act does not apply in respect of personal data about a deceased individual, except that the provisions relating to the disclosure of personal data and section 24 (protection of personal data) apply in respect of personal data about an individual who has been dead for 10 years or less) --> i.e. s 24 protection obligation under PDPA still applies if individual has been dead for 10 years or less, but it will no longer apply after 10 years has passed from his death

- My Digital Lock 
o First consider whether the document is clearly about an individual
* E.g. flight manifests (Tiger Airways), letters to identify former employees (Jump Rope)  
o Then, if information is not clearly about the individual (e.g. in Durant, the documents related to Mr Durant’s complaint to the FSA), the Commissioner will consider whether the information is biographically significant
* E.g. IM communications, which display the sender’s name on each message (Executive Coach Intl), are not always considered personal data. 
* The content of the message must convey information about one or more individuals 

Element 4: “An individual who can be identified” 
- PDPC: An individual can be identified if that individual can be singled out from other individuals by an organization based on one or more characteristics of the data or other pieces of information 
o Standard of proof – BOP? Reasonably practicable, rather than merely theoretically possible? 
o My choice – reasonably practicable, in light of the capabilities of the org. 
- Indirect identification – where identification is possible where data is viewed in conjunction with other information 
o Likely to have access – submit that it should be “probable” or “likely” on a BOP, a middle ground between “theoretically possible” and “serious possibility” 
o The tricky part – large amounts of data can often be very unique to a person, e.g. transaction history or purchasing data. A week’s transaction history may not be sufficient, but a year’s history may be enough to positively identify someone. 
* This is a tricky area, probably not going to be tested 

*ORGANIZATIONS 	
Includes (non-exhaustive) any individual, company, association or body of persons regardless of where formed, recognised, resident or having an office / place of business (s 2 PDPA)

Daniel Seng, in Chesterman’s book: A good working definition of a data organization is “a natural or legal person who either alone or jointly with others controls the collection, processing, use or disclosure of personal data”. 

Individuals can be organizations – e.g. sole proprietors like insurance/property agents, taxi drivers 
- Property agent – Chua Yong Boon Justin 
- Financial consultant – Ang Rui Song 

But excludes individuals acting in a personal or domestic capacity 

A data intermediary / data processor also processes data – but it does so on behalf of another organization (data controller)

Exceptions 
Network service providers are not liable under PDPA (they’re still organizations though)
- s 26 Electronic Transactions Act – Liability of network service providers 
o (1) Subject to subsection (2), a network service provider shall not be subject to any liability under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 in respect of third-party material in the form of electronic records to which he merely provides access.
o (3) “provides access”, in relation to third-party material, means the provision of the necessary technical means by which third-party material may be accessed and includes the automatic and temporary storage of the third-party material for the purpose of providing access; 
“third-party”, in relation to a network service provider, means a person over whom the provider has no effective control.

Exclusions from “organisations” --> i.e. not considered as part of “organisation” so no personal data obligations
Exclusions are from Parts 3 to 6B PDPA, meaning all the personal data obligations. DNC registry obligations still apply. 

Individuals acting in a personal / domestic capacity – s 4(1)(a) PDPA
- s 4(1) PDPA – Parts III to VI shall not impose and obligations on … any individual acting in a personal or domestic capacity 
- Similar exemptions in HK, EU, India 

Employee acting in the course of employment with an organisation – s 4(1)(b) PDPA
- Employers are liable for acts and breaches of employees acting in the course of their employment –
o Any act done by a person in the course of his employment is treated as being done by the employer as well as him, regardless of whether it was done with the employer’s knowledge or approval – s 53(1) PDPA
o It is a defence for the employer to prove that he took such reasonable steps to prevent the employee from doing the act – s 53(2) PDPA
- See also new provisions that impose individual liability for egregious breaches – under Enforcement doc, individual liability

Public agency (covered under a separate framework / law) – s 4(1)(c) PDPA
- Includes Government, including any ministry, department, agency or organ of state. Tribunals appointed under written law, or statutory body designated by the Minister in the Gazette. 
- Justification 
o Avoid public agencies from incurring fines 
o Allowing disclosure between public agencies 
o PDPA balances individual interests vs business needs – government agencies are another thing entirely 
o There are already existing laws to provide protection, perhaps even stronger protection, for personal data handled by public agencies 
o E.g. Public Sector (Governance) Act 2018, and other manuals, technical recommendations etc. 

Business contact information – s 4(5) PDPA: Parts III to VIA shall not apply to business contact information 
- Reasons – Such information is in most cases publicly available. Business information should not be considered personal data, since it is generated in connection with and for professional objectives 
- Obligations affected: Consent, Purpose Limitation, Access/Correction, Accuracy, Protection, Retention, Cross-border Transfer, Notification of Breach 
- Relevant case – Comfort, Citicab
o Taxi drivers are sole proprietors, their mobile numbers are business contact information. Practice is to use their number to arrange pickup points, consistent with the commercial relationship between drivers and hirers 

“business contact information” means an individual’s name, position name or title, business telephone number, business address, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other similar information about the individual, not provided by the individual solely for his or her personal purposes

*Data intermediaries / processors (a subtype of organization) 
Definition: an organization which processes personal data on behalf of another organization (data controller), but does not include an employee of that other organization (i.e. employee of a data controller is NOT a data intermediary) 

Key idea: They have fewer obligations under the PDPA 
s 4(2) PDPA – Intermediaries are excluded from data protection obligations EXCEPT:
- Security/Protection obligation – s 24 
- Retention limitation obligation – s 25 
- Assessment of data breach and notify data controller – s 26C(3)(a)
o Notify principal organization (the data controller) of data breach [NO NEED TO NOTIFY PDPC, CF OBLIGATION OF DATA CONTROLLER], and the principal must conduct an assessment of whether the data breach is a notifiable one 
- Obligations of data intermediary of public agency – s 26E
o DI must without undue delay, notify the public agency of the occurrence of the data breach – if it has reason to believe that a data breach has occurred

Who is an intermediary? 
- Official definition - an organization which processes personal data on behalf of another organization, but does not include an employee of that other organization – s 2(1) PDPA
o “process” is given a wide scope under PDPA, includes any act of recording, holding, organisation, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, combination, transmission, erasure or destruction 
o Practically speaking, whether a software or service provider is regarded as a processor of personal data will largely turn on the degree of control it has over the software it operates, and the degree of control over the systemic processing of personal data

- Cf: Data controller 
o Not a defined term under PDPA 
o Refers to the organization on whose behalf the data intermediary is processing personal data 
o Controls the purposes and sometimes the manner of processing by the data intermediary (normally through contract)
o Responsible for the personal data processed on its behalf by the DI

- Various scenarios – as suggested by Daniel Seng in Chesterman tb
o Social media sites – who has control?
* In some regards, the user has control – can delete their stuff and choose privacy settings 
* In other regards, the social media provider has control 
* Fraley v Facebook – showed user’s likes of sponsored stories without the ability of the user to opt out, an unlawful use of the member’s personality, thus violating the user’s right to publicity 
* Settlement between Facebook and the US FTC – Facebook deceived users by telling them they could keep their information private, but then allowing it to be shared and made public – shows that, particularly where Facebook derives revenue from targeted ads based on users’ affinity data, Facebook is a data organization rather than an intermediary – it is actually regulating the collection, processing and usage of users’ personal data, and only offers its users limited control over these processes 
o Recommendation system providers
* Taken alone, cannot be said that each of these providers control the collection and processing of user data 
* But the decision regarding which aspects of behaviour to monitor is taken jointly by the retail site, ad-serving intermediary and the provider of the recommendation system 
* Instead of saying the retailer is the one who controls the engagement of the user’s personal data, it’s more realistic to regard all the parties as being collectively responsible and acting as data organizations in concert with one another 
o Cloud storage operators and service providers (AWS etc.) should be classified as intermediaries 
* They are technically processing data on behalf of their clients, but the services are client neural and purpose agnostic, and being done on their clients’ behalf 
* But Amazon itself may be an organization for the purposes of data collected from its own clients, even if processed using its own infrastructure 

Obligations of data intermediaries 
- Security obligation – s 24 (see below) 
o S 24 – protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, …, or similar risks 
o “Reasonable” measures – depends on the sensitivity of the data and potential harm caused in the event of a breach 
* Would be helpful to have such considerations expressly spelled out, as HK Ordinance did 
o EU Directive and HK Ordinance further require the organization to guard data against accidental loss - probably encrypt the data on the hardware instead of just password-protecting access 
o Daniel Seng recommends real consequences for breaches of data security through s 32 – presumption of damage, court orders for the organization to offer all assistance to the individual to deal with and compensate the individual for all foreseeable consequences of the breach 
- Retention limitation obligation – s 25
o S 25 – An organisation shall cease to retain its documents containing personal data, or remove the means by which the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that — 
a. the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal data; and 
b. retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
o Practical difficulties in application
* No clear definition of the “lifespan” of data 
* For the intermediary – the purpose for which personal data is collected may not be known to the intermediary 

Disclosure of data to DIs:
- Pursuant to contract 
- What clauses/obligations must be included? 
o Data controllers are responsible for the personal data processed on its behalf by the DI – they must put in place contractual protections to limit the scope of data processing by data intermediaries, so that the intermediaries don’t breach the PDPA 
- What optional clauses/obligations may be included (depending on scope of services?) 
o If DI is collecting data for DC, DC can include a clause that allows DI to obtain consent on behalf of DC. Or the DC can find another means to obtain consent directly 

*TECHNICAL EXCLUSIONS 
Not protected under PDPA:
- Data about an individual on record in existence for 100 or more years (s 4(4)(a) PDPA) --> i.e. data not protected anymore after 100 years has passed after being recorded
- Data relating to a deceased person dead for 10 years or more (s 4(4)(b) PDPA)
o But for a deceased person who has been dead for less than 10 years, only disclosure and protection requirements under s 24 PDPA apply
o Decision maker can be designated in the deceased’s will
o But since people don’t normally appoint someone to handle their data, then just follow the “nearest relative” similar to intestate succession 
- Provisions of other written law that:
o Provides greater/additional exemptions, or 
o Removes any exemptions in relation to an organization or a type of PD 

Other laws override PDPA – s 4(6) PDPA
- Nothing in the PDPA affects any authority, right, privilege or immunity, conferred, or obligation imposed, by or under the law 
o If PDPA obligations are inconsistent with other written laws (including regulatory requirements and subsidiary legislation), orgs are required to comply with that other written law, can disapply PDPA to the extent that of the inconsistency --> OTHER WRITTEN LAW WOULD PREVAIL
- Orgs are still required to comply with the other data protection obligations which are not inconsistent with its obligations under written law 

- *Written law does NOT include contractual obligations – performance of contractual obligations is not an excuse for contravening the PDPA 
o Essentially, you cannot contract out of the PDPA 
- E.g.
o Re Exceltec Property Management – Voter Lists on notice boards (names, units, voting shares) – legally required to be displayed under BMSMA. Provided that duration of display is no longer than necessary 

**Part B: Obligations of organizations – Overview 
1. When are organizations permitted to collect, use and disclose (CUD) personal data? OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH ON OR BEFORE IT COLLECTS PD
a. Purpose Limitation Obligation
b. Consent Obligation (one of several legal bases under which organisations may CUD PD) 
c. Purpose Notification Obligation

NB: legal bases for processing PD under PDPA include:
- Legal obligations / authority under written law
- Consent and general deemed consent
- Deemed consent by contractual necessity
- Vital interests of individuals
- Public matters
- Legitimate interests of organisations
- Business assess transactions
- Business improvement purposes and research

2. What must organizations do while processing personal data?
d. Data Minimization (part of Purpose Limitation Obligation) – ensure relevant, accurate and complete PD is used by organisations
e. Accuracy Obligation

3. Storage and security requirements of personal data:
f. Protection Obligation
g. Data Breach Notification Obligation
h. Retention Limitation Obligation - cease retaining documents relating to PD once they are no longer required

4. What must organizations do if they disclose or transfer personal data to another organization (Data Controllers – DC, or Data Intermediaries - DI)?
i. Obligations relating to disclosure and outsourcing to DIs – Data Controller is still responsible for acts of DI
j. Transfer Limitation Obligation – for overseas transfers, s 9-12 PDPR

NB: PD is usually disclosed to Dis pursuant to contract between the DC-DI, key question is what clauses and obligations must be included? DC are responsible for what DI do in relation to processing, so DC MUST include some obligations on the DI to ensure it does not exceed the intended scope of processing and put the DC in a position where it contravenes the PDPA 

5. What governance measures must organizations put in place?
k. Accountability Obligation
l. Giving effect to rights of individuals (Part C)

REASONABLENESS STANDARD IN PDPA – AN UNDERLYING THREAD
Standard of reasonableness in PDPA is assessed on an objective standard – looking at industry, sector, circumstances, what would be reasonable to meet the obligations in the Act? 

An organisation’s subjective view on what is reasonable is irrelevant.

Compliance with Act
11.—(1)  In meeting its responsibilities under this Act, an organisation must consider what a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.
(2)  An organisation is responsible for personal data in its possession or under its control.
(3)  An organisation must designate one or more individuals to be responsible for ensuring that the organisation complies with this Act.
(4)  An individual designated under subsection (3) may delegate to another individual the responsibility conferred by that designation.
(5)  An organisation must make available to the public the business contact information of at least one of the individuals designated under subsection (3) or delegated under subsection (4).
(5A)  Without limiting subsection (5), an organisation is deemed to have satisfied that subsection if the organisation makes available the business contact information of any individual mentioned in subsection (3) in any prescribed manner.
[40/2020]
(6)  The designation of an individual by an organisation under subsection (3) does not relieve the organisation of any of its obligations under this Act.Policies and practices
12.  An organisation must —
(a)develop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet the obligations of the organisation under this Act;(b)develop a process to receive and respond to complaints that may arise with respect to the application of this Act;(c)communicate to its staff information about the organisation’s policies and practices mentioned in paragraph (a); and(d)make information available on request about —
(i)the policies and practices mentioned in paragraph (a); and(ii)the complaint process mentioned in paragraph (b).
Not complying with certain obligations – Re Jump Rope (Singapore) [2016] SGPDPC 21 
- Don’t need to comply with consent or notification obligation if it is reasonable not to do so – e.g. if the person is subject to disciplinary action by the org, and consent is unlikely to be forthcoming 
o There may be situations where the org is acting reasonably in disclosing PD in respect of a blacklisting to warn others 
o BUT – the circumstances are limited, depends on the context and circumstances in which disclosure was made 
- But the org should still comply with the neighboring obligations of consent – notification obligation and purpose limitation obligation 
- Only use the PD for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances, notify the person about the CUD 

Reasonable lapses in data protection – MyRepublic Limited 
- The Act does not demand infallibility on an org’s PD processing activities and systems. Rather, it requires orgs to do what is reasonable to fulfil their obligations – MyRepublic at [7] 
o The incident was caused by administrative time lag – the Complainant’s GIRO deduction for last fee payment was updated with the Org after the debt aging report was created, so the Complainant’s account was reflected in the aging report and sent to Apex thereafter 
o Batch processing of arrears is common and the administrative time-lag was one day. A weekly update of customers’ account status is a reasonable practice 
*a. Purpose Notification Obligation (s 20 PDPA)
OVERVIEW 
Individual must be notified about all purposes of CUD of PD, on or before the CUD. 
- If subsequent use for other purpose, must inform of that purpose before use 
- Must give contact information of a person who can answer for the organization the individual’s questions about the CUD of personal data. 

When collecting PD from another org, must inform the other org of purpose of collection so that other org can know whether disclosure is allowed 

Exceptions to notification obligation 
- Deemed consent – s 20(3)(a) read with s 15 
- PD is collected without consent under the exemptions to the Consent Obligation – s 20(3)(a) read with s 17 

20.—(1) For the purposes of sections 14(1)(a) and 18(b), an organisation shall inform the individual of —
(a)the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data, as the case may be, on or before collecting the personal data;(b)any other purpose of the use or disclosure of the personal data of which the individual has not been informed under paragraph (a), before the use or disclosure of the personal data for that purpose; and(c)on request by the individual, the business contact information of a person who is able to answer on behalf of the organisation the individual’s questions about the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data.
(2) An organisation, on or before collecting personal data about an individual from another organisation without the consent of the individual, shall provide the other organisation with sufficient information regarding the purpose of the collection to allow that other organisation to determine whether the disclosure would be in accordance with this Act.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION NOTES 
Notification of purposes is sufficient, no need to notify of individual activities 
- E.g. if PD collected to enable delivery, just say delivery. Don’t need to say entry into database, printed out, passed to deliver personnel who may be external contractors etc. 

“On or before” 
- Normally notification and consent are sought before collection, to cover all activities for the stated purposes once collected 
- If after the personal data is collected and the org wants to use for additional purposes, must notify the individual and obtain fresh consent 
- Where PD is collected on a periodic basis, individual must be notified of this prior to first collection (PCDC Advisory Guidelines) 
- Where there is no contract involved in notification, advisable to give the notification of purpose as early as practicable in a manner as noticeable as possible 
- Where PD is collected as part of a contract, notification should be given before formation of the contract 

Subsidiary purposes
- No concrete rules on depth of purposes that must be notified – the aim is for the individual to comprehend all the purposes the data will be put to 
o If there are disclosures made to others, should be notified to individuals 
* If the list of recipients is too long, then categorize them into recognizable classes or types of recipients 
- Even where consent can be deemed, it is often a good idea to notify of purposes anyway to remove ambiguity – there are subsidiary purposes for which the data is used, which the individual is not aware of 

Manner and form of notification
- No specification – the most appropriate manner or form of notification depends on the circumstances 
o E.g. for CCTV surveillance, best place is a sign by the entrance to the premises 
- Notification can be provided through a data protection policy
o This is feasible but several problems 
o Need to ensure that data protection policy is brought to the attention of the individual 
o Runs the risk of being too broad – may need to be supplemented with a more specific notification of purpose 

Suggested content of privacy notices for external parties – PDPC Key Concepts Guidelines
- Orgs should endeavor to ensure that their notifications are clear, easily comprehensible, provide appropriate information and are easily accessible 
- In considering how to notify individuals of their purpose, orgs should consider: 
o Drafting notices that are easy to understand and appropriate to the intended audience, providing headings or clear indication of where the individuals should look to determine the purposes for which their personal data would be collected, used or disclosed and avoiding legalistic language or terminology that would confuse or mislead individuals reading it; 
o Using a ‘layered notice’ where appropriate, by providing the most important (e.g. summary of purposes) or basic information (e.g. contact details of the organisation’s DPO) more prominently (e.g. on the first page of an agreement) and more detailed information elsewhere (e.g. on the organisation’s website). A layered approach is useful when individuals do not want to read all the information at the point of transaction, or when the medium of transaction is not suitable for conveying detailed information (e.g. telephone conversation); 
o Considering if some purposes may be of special concern or be unexpected to the individual given the context of the transaction, and whether those purposes should be highlighted in an appropriate manner; 
o Selecting the most appropriate channel(s) to provide the notification (e.g. in writing through a form, on a website, or orally in person); and 
o Developing processes to regularly review the effectiveness of and relevance of the notification policies and practices.

Stating consequences if data is not collected
- No need to list every consequence, only the significant ones 
- If some consequences can be avoided or lessened by the individual providing some PD, this should be mentioned 


EXCEPTIONS 
No notification required where PD collected without consent (i.e. if consent not required) 
(3) Subsection (1) shall not apply if —
(a)the individual is deemed to have consented to the collection, use or disclosure, as the case may be, under section 15 or 15A; or(b)the organisation collects, uses or discloses the personal data without the consent of the individual in accordance with section 17.
- s 17 --> Collection, use and disclosure without consent (refers to exemptions First and Second Schedule)

*Exception to the exception – Notification still required in employment context 
Summary: 
- Where the org is entering, managing or terminating an employment relationship with an individual, it must still notify the individual about the purpose of the CUD of the individual’s PD. 
- Upon request by individual, Org must provide access to someone who can answer the individual’s questions about the use of the data
- Blanket notification (e.g. staff manuals or bulletins) is permitted to discharge this obligation – Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA) 

(4) Despite subsection (3), an organisation must comply with subsection (5) on or before collecting, using or disclosing personal data about an individual for the purpose of or in relation to the organisation —
(a)entering into an employment relationship with the individual or appointing the individual to any office; or(b)managing or terminating the employment relationship with or appointment of the individual.
(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), the organisation must inform the individual of the following:
(a)the purpose for which the organisation is collecting, using or disclosing (as the case may be) the personal data about the individual;(b)on request by the individual, the business contact information of a person who is able to answer the individual’s questions about that collection, use or disclosure (as the case may be) on behalf of the organisation.

CONCEPTUAL 
Serves as a link between purpose and consent 

Rationales 
- Notification sets the boundaries of what the org is allowed to do with the data
- Enables individuals to make informed decisions whether to give consent 
- Individuals better placed to understand whether the collection/use/disclosure complies with the Purpose Limitation Obligation 

Position in the EU 
- PD must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with these purposes – DP Directive, Art 5 GDPR 
- General transparency obligation on organizations that handle personal data – communicate purpose in clear and plain language, make individuals aware of risks, safeguards, rights 
- Hannah Lim’s observation – notification requirements under EU GDPR are far more comprehensive than the PDPA 

*b. Consent (and its exceptions) – legal bases for processing PD
NB: PDPA is NOT consent based, in practice look at the exceptions to consent first.

OBLIGATIONS (S 13-15 PDPA)
Basics 
Basics 
- Consent must be obtained before personal data is collected, used or disclosed 
- Consent is effective for the purposes notified to the individual – s 14(1)(b)
- Consent is invalid if false or misleading information regarding CUD has been provided to the individual – includes things where terms are stated in vague/inaccurate terms, in illegible front or placed in an obscure area of a document or location that is difficult to access – PDPC 
- “Reasonable” requirement under s 11 – affords latitude for deciding on a case-by-case basis and allows the PDPA to respond better to future technological advances 

For personal data collected before commencement of PDPA:
- Can be used for the purposes for which they were collected, unless the individual withdraws his consent 
- This is limited to existing uses that are reasonable, taking into account the organization’s business – MICA 
- Hannah Lim’s disagreement – the reasonableness requirement is misplaced, since the Limitation of Purpose Obligation (s 18) uses a test of “appropriateness” and not reasonableness 

Consent as a condition of providing a service 
s 14(2)(a) PDPA– prohibits organization from requiring consent to CUD of PD beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service 
- Prohibits orgs from requiring individuals to consent to uses or disclosures of PD beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service, e.g. NRIC numbers, in many instances 

s 14(2)(a):
(2) An organisation shall not —
(a)as a condition of providing a product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to that individual; or
PDPC opinion - organizations may not be prohibited from requiring consent in some situations – e.g. lucky draw opportunities which are conditional upon provision of personal data
o Hannah Lim disagrees - unless the contract is purely to enter into lucky draw or to obtain a discount, this would not be the case. The lucky draw/discounts are products or services, there can be no conditions attached to the provision of these services beyond what is required for the provision of these services 
o Permissible according to author – sell personal data in exchange for a discount voucher 
o Essentially allows individuals to decide how to trade their personal data for goods and services

Commentary by Hannah Lim 
- The way the provision has been worded dilutes the effect – the org can request for the information, but cannot require it. Must inform the individual that the data is not mandatory 

Manner and form of consent 
Not specified in PDPA. Touchstone is whether the relevant provision is effective in seeking consent from the individual
- Broadly worded consent requests, opt-out provisions 
o PDPC doesn’t generally object to broadly-worded consent requests (AIA Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 10) or opt-out provisions (YesTuition Agency [2016] SGPDPC 5) 
* Tuition’s ID numbers and images were displayed without their permission, not consistent with the privacy policy, which was to collect and use their PD to provide a matching service with appropriate students only 

For evidentiary purposes, best to have consent recorded in writing or electronically 

Opt-in and opt-out mechanisms 
- PDPC has made clear that a failure to opt out is not always regarded as consent 
- Whether or not a failure to opt out can be regarded as consent will depend on the circumstances … the opt out method has many variants, and depending on its implementation could be more or less likely to constitute consent – PDPC Key Concepts, 12.10 
- Examples: 
o Failure to tick an opt-out box above signature field, counted as consent 
o Failure to mail back to the organization a consent opt out letter – not consent 

Deemed consent (s 15 PDPA)
Summary
- An individual can be deemed to have provided consent without having provided express consent 
- This occurs when: 
o The individual voluntarily provides their PD to the organization for that purpose, AND
o It is reasonable that the individual would voluntarily provide that data 
- The consent is applicable only for that specific purpose 

Deemed consent for transfer of data from organization to organization 
- When an individual gives consent (including deemed consent) for an organization to disclose their PD to another organization for a purpose, he is deemed to consent to the CUD of that PD by the other organization, for that purpose. 

s 15 PDPA
15.—(1) An individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual by an organisation for a purpose if —
(a)the individual, without actually giving consent referred to in section 14, voluntarily provides the personal data to the organisation for that purpose; and(b)it is reasonable that the individual would voluntarily provide the data.
(2) If an individual gives, or is deemed to have given, consent to the disclosure of personal data about the individual by one organisation to another organisation for a particular purpose, the individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data for that particular purpose by that other organisation.
Notes – Yip Man, Understanding the Consent Obligation 
- Burden of proof rests on organizations to show that there is deemed consent 
- Whether the individual would have voluntarily provided the data is an objective question 
- The concept of deemed consent is subject to s 18 limitations (purpose limitation obligation)

Deemed consent for multiple purposes? 
- The concept of deemed consent applies well to situations that have only one main purpose – may be more difficult to apply deemed consent to more than one purpose in a given scenario, especially where the purposes have a tenuous relationship to each other – Hannah Lim 

Deemed consent through action 
- Context-sensitive – do a person’s actions indicate consent to collection, use or disclosure? 
- Deemed consent through action can overlap with actual consent – e.g. CCTV sign outside door which states that the individual consents to having his image recorded if he steps on the premises – actual consent by stepping into premises, also deemed consent by providing the images to the CCTV 

Deemed consent for use through disclosure
- 15(2) – an if an individual gives or is deemed to have given consent to the disclosure of personal data to a 2nd org, then he is deemed to have consent to the CUD of his PD by the second org for that particular purpose 

Cases: 
- Re Universal Travel Corp Pte Ltd – passengers sought confirmation of cancellation of their flight for insurance purposes – the tour agency disclosed to each of the 4 passengers the names of all 4 affected passengers. PDPC held that passengers could not be deemed to have consented to disclosure, since each passenger required only his own personal information for the purpose of processing the insurance claim 

Deemed consent – where information necessary for conclusion of contract 
S 15(3) PDPA
When an individual P deals with an organization A, P is deemed to consent to certain activities where P provides PD to A with a view to entering a contract with A 
- E.g. if you sign up for a mobile data plan, you are deemed to have consented to the telco disclosing your PD to their database provider, customer support agency etc. 

What activities are P deemed to consent to? 
- Disclosure of PD by A to another organization B 
- Collection and use of the PD by the other organization B 
- Onward disclosure by B to another organization (C, D, F…)

Conditions of use of PD 
- Consent is only deemed for collection, use and disclosures, where reasonably necessary for the conclusion of the contract between P and A 

This deemed consent can propagate indefinitely 
- S 15(4) PDPA – an organization that receives PD from B also has deemed consent for collection/use/onward disclosure, as if it received the data from A itself 

EXCEPTION – Deemed consent does not negate the company’s PD obligations under the contract – s 15(9) PDPA
- Where the contract restricts the PD that may be disclosed 
- Or where the contract restricts the purposes for which PD may be disclosed by A to another organisation

s 15(3) onwards 
(3)  Without limiting subsection (2) and subject to subsection (9), an individual (P) who provides personal data to an organisation (A) with a view to P entering into a contract with A is deemed to consent to the following where reasonably necessary for the conclusion of the contract between P and A:
(a)the disclosure of that personal data by A to another organisation (B);(b)the collection and use of that personal data by B;(c)the disclosure of that personal data by B to another organisation.
(4)  Where an organisation collects personal data disclosed to it by B under subsection (3)(c), subsection (3)(b) and (c) applies to the organisation as if the personal data were disclosed by A to the organisation under subsection (3)(a).
(5)  Subsections (3) and (4) apply to personal data provided before the applicable date by an individual to an organisation with a view to the individual entering into a contract with the organisation —
(a)on or after the applicable date; or(b)which contract was entered into before the applicable date and remains in force on that date,
as if subsections (3) and (4) —
(c)were in force when the personal data was so provided; and(d)had continued in force until the applicable date.

Deemed consent – where PD disclosed pursuant to contract and necessary for performance of contract 
S 15(6) PDPA
An individual P is deemed to consent to certain activities by an organization A where: 
- P enters a contract with organization A, and 
- P provides PD to A pursuant to or in relation to that contract 

What activities are P deemed to consent to? 
- Disclosure to another organization B, where reasonably necessary for the following purposes:
o For performance of the contract, OR 
o For performance of a contract between A and B: 
* which is entered into at P’s request OR
* which a reasonable person would consider to be in P’s interest 
- Collection and use of the PD by B 
o If necessary for the same purposes 
- Onward disclosure by B to another organization, for the same purposes 

Deemed consent propagates indefinitely – s 15(7)
- An organization that receives PD under this section can further use or disclose it as if it received the PD directly from A

EXCEPTION – Deemed consent does not negate the company’s PD obligations under the contract – s 15(9) 
- Where the contract restricts the PD that may be disclosed 
- Or where the contract restricts the purposes for which PD may be disclosed 


(6)  Without limiting subsection (2) and subject to subsection (9), an individual (P) who enters into a contract with an organisation (A) and provides personal data to A pursuant or in relation to that contract is deemed to consent to the following:
(a)the disclosure of that personal data by A to another organisation (B), where the disclosure is reasonably necessary —
(i)for the performance of the contract between P and A; or(ii)for the conclusion or performance of a contract between A and B which is entered into at P’s request, or which a reasonable person would consider to be in P’s interest;(b)the collection and use of that personal data by B, where the collection and use are reasonably necessary for any purpose mentioned in paragraph (a);(c)the disclosure of that personal data by B to another organisation, where the disclosure is reasonably necessary for any purpose mentioned in paragraph (a).
(7)  Where an organisation collects personal data disclosed to it by B under subsection (6)(c), subsection (6)(b) and (c) applies to the organisation as if the personal data were disclosed by A to the organisation under subsection (6)(a).
(8)  Subsections (6) and (7) apply to personal data provided before the applicable date by an individual to an organisation in relation to a contract that the individual entered into before that date with the organisation, and which remains in force on that date, as if subsections (6) and (7) —
(a)were in force when the personal data was so provided; and(b)had continued in force until the applicable date.
(9)  Subsections (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) do not affect any obligation under the contract between P and A that specifies or restricts —
(a)the personal data provided by P that A may disclose to another organisation; or(b)the purposes for which A may disclose the personal data provided by P to another organisation.
Deemed consent by notification – S 15A PDPA 
TLDR – organisation must notify individual of the intended CUD of data and purpose. Provide reasonable opt out period, and if individual does not opt out, consent is deemed. 
- Must conduct DPIA (data protection impact assessment) prior to CUD --> that the proposed CUD is NOT likely to have an adverse effect on the individual
- Take reasonable steps to bring to the attention of the individual: (i) organisation’s intent to CUD PD, (ii) purpose for which PD will be CUD, and (iii) a reasonable period in which the individual may notify the organisation that it does NOT consent to the proposed CUD
- Any PD collected under this legal basis is NOT allowed to be used for marketing. 

Prescribed purposes: 
- Not stated in schedules. But PDPC Consultation Paper did say that data collected via deemed consent by notification is NOT allowed to be used for marketing purposes 


15A.—(1)  This section applies to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about an individual by an organisation on or after the date of commencement of section 7 of the Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2020.
(2)  Subject to subsection (3), an individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual by an organisation if —
(a)the organisation satisfies the requirements in subsection (4); and(b)the individual does not notify the organisation, before the expiry of the period mentioned in subsection (4)(b)(iii), that the individual does not consent to the proposed collection, use or disclosure of the personal data by the organisation.
(3)  Subsection (2) does not apply to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual for any prescribed purpose.
(4)  For the purposes of subsection (2)(a), the organisation must, before collecting, using or disclosing any personal data about the individual —
(a)conduct an assessment to determine that the proposed collection, use or disclosure of the personal data is not likely to have an adverse effect on the individual; (DPIA!!!)(b)take reasonable steps to bring the following information to the attention of the individual:
(i)the organisation’s intention to collect, use or disclose the personal data;(ii)the purpose for which the personal data will be collected, used or disclosed;(iii)[OPT OUT MECHANISM] a reasonable period within which, and a reasonable manner by which, the individual may notify the organisation that the individual does not consent to the organisation’s proposed collection, use or disclosure of the personal data; and(c)satisfy any other prescribed requirements.
(5)  The organisation must, in respect of the assessment mentioned in subsection (4)(a) —
(a)identify any adverse effect that the proposed collection, use or disclosure of the personal data for the purpose concerned is likely to have on the individual;(b)identify and implement reasonable measures to —
(i)eliminate the adverse effect;(ii)reduce the likelihood that the adverse effect will occur; or(iii)mitigate the adverse effect; and(c)comply with any other prescribed requirements.
Withdrawal of consent 
Consent (both actual and deemed) can be withdrawn by an individual at any time by reasonable notice to the organisation – S 16(1) PDPA
- On receipt of notice, the organisation shall inform the individual of the likely consequences of withdrawing his consent – S 16(2) PDPA
- Difficult to prescribe timeframe for reasonable notice, but 10 business days as a rule of thumb – PDPC 

Obligations of organisation upon withdrawal – S 16(4) PDPA
- Cease collection, use or disclosure of the PD 
- Cause intermediaries and agents to cease CUD of PD 
- EXCEPTION: – unless such CUD without consent is authorized under PDPA or other written law 

There can be no withdrawal of consent for PD and purposes for which consent was never given – i.e. any processing of data under the First or Second Schedule – organisation can deal with this data for specified purposes, even if the individual objects. 
- I think you can still withdraw deemed consent under s 15 though 

Organizations cannot prohibit an individual from withdrawing consent, but that doesn’t affect legal consequences arising from such withdrawal – S 16(3) PDPA 
- E.g. breach of contract, inability to continue providing personalized services etc. 

Organizations are advised to facilitate withdrawal of consent – PDPC 
- Can do so through consent withdrawal policies that are accessible to individuals, and which clearly inform individuals on the form and manner to submit their withdrawals 

Withdrawal needs to be clear about what it pertains to, in order to be effective 
- State purposes for which withdrawal is requested, specific channels of communication 
- Commission has taken a business-friendly stance – e.g. for withdrawal of consent to receive marketing messages, where channel of communication is not stated, the withdrawal only applies to the channel by which the withdrawal notification was sent. So email withdrawal means the org can continue sending SMS marketing material, unless explicitly requested not to do so 

No requirement to cascade withdrawal of consent 
- Orgs for whom consent is withdrawn have no obligation to inform 3P orgs (which are not intermediaries) of withdrawal of consent. 
- Onus is on the individual to seek out 3Ps to whom data has been disclosed 
- Problems:
o Onerous to the individual 
o No obligation for org to inform the individual of the 3ps to whom data was disclosed 

Collection of data from another organization 
Before an organisation collects PD from 3P, it must always provide the purpose of the collections to the individuals who are the data subjects 
- If the organisation collects PD from 3P and the 3P has no consent to disclose the PD, both organisations will be in breach of the Consent Obligation, for collection/disclosure without consent 

Exercising due diligence before collection of PD from 3P
- The collecting organisation will be in breach of the PDPA if it collects data from 3P where individual has not consented to the 3P’s disclosure 
- Because of this, organisations should exercise due diligence when collecting PD from 3Ps – one or more of the following would be prudent:
o Obtain an undertaking from the 3P that it has the requisite consent 
o Obtain confirmation from the individual in writing 
o Obtain copy of documents detailing consent by the individuals concerned (often not practically possible because of commercial reasons, business secrets, confidentiality etc.)

*EXCEPTIONS WITHIN PDPA (CAN COLLECT WITHOUT CONSENT) (S 17 PDPA)
S 13(b) PDPA – consent not required where CUD is permitted or mandated under any written law 
- Cases: use the MCST cases to illustrate 

S 4(5) PDPA – business contact information excluded from the scope Parts III - VIA (see general exceptions above) 

*S 17(1) PDPA: An organisation may —
(a) collect personal data about an individual, without the individual’s consent or from a source other than the individual, in the circumstances or for the purposes, and subject to any condition, in the First Schedule or Part 1 of the Second Schedule;
(b) use personal data about an individual without the individual’s consent, in the circumstances or for the purposes, and subject to any condition, in the First Schedule or Part 2 of the Second Schedule; or
(c) disclose personal data about an individual without the individual’s consent, in the circumstances or for the purposes, and subject to any condition, in the First Schedule or Part 3 of the Second Schedule.

*1ST SCHEDULE EXCEPTIONS 
Summary of exceptions (important ones) – details below 
- Legitimate interests 
o Legitimate interests (general) 
o Evaluative purposes 
o Managing or terminating employment relationship 
o Documents produced in business, employment and professional settings 
o Conferment of benefits to the individual 
- Business asset transactions
- Matters affecting public 
o Publicly available data
o Solely for artistic of literary purposes 
o Disclosure for archival or historical purposes 

*Vital interests of individuals – Part 1 
CUD necessary for any purpose which is “clearly in the interests of the individual” – para 1 
- Requirements 
o Consent cannot be obtained in a timely way; or 
o The individual would not reasonably be expected to withhold consent 
- Where the org CUDs PD under this para, it must, as soon as practicable, notify the individual of the CUD and the purpose for CUD 

Emergency – where CUD is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of the individual or another individual – para 2 

CUD where consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the health or safety of the individual or another individual will be seriously affected – para 3

CUD is for the purpose of contacting the next-of-kin or a friend of any injured, ill or deceased individual – para 4

*Matters affecting public – Part 2 
CUD of PD that is publicly available – para 1
- Definition of “publicly available” – personal data that is generally available to the public, includes personal data which can be observed by reasonably expected means at a location or event at which the individual appears and that is open to the public
o “public” – guidance probably to be gained from copyright cases 
* Data is generally available to the public if any member of the public could obtain or access the data with few or no restrictions. But just because restrictions are present doesn’t mean the data isn’t publicly available – PDPC 
* E.g. 
* Social media groups – there are restrictions, but considered public because membership to the group can be easily obtained. 
* Cf closed circle of individual’s family and friends – not publicly available, even if it is inadvertently disclosed to a member of the public who is not personally known to the individual 
* What about country clubs where membership costs tens of thousands of dollars? Is the club entry fee a barrier for information to be considered publicly available? 
* Re Exceltec Property Management – Unit numbers considered publicly available, visible to the public with “few or no restrictions” – can be seen on notice boards as required by BMSMA, and also on the SLA Registry. 
- Observable personal data
o “observed by reasonably expected means” – objective test, individuals ought to have reasonably expected that their personal data would be collected in that particular manner at that location or event 
o “place that is open to the public” – the existence of few or no restrictions to entry would indicate a place that is open to the public 
* But not much guidance, restrictions on entry not conclusive 
- Some conceptual problems – see conceptual discussion below 

CUD is in the national interest – para 2
- E.g. national defence, national security, public security, the maintenance of essential services, the conduct of international affairs 

Solely for artistic or literary purposes – para 3
- Can PD be CUD solely for artistic or literary purposes even if subsequent profits are made from the CUD? 
o Legislation is unclear but seems possible 
o Thus, very broad 

CUD of PD about an individual solely for archival or historical purposes, if a reasonable person would not consider the personal data to be too sensitive to the individual to be CUD at the proposed time – para 4

CUD of PD by a news organisation solely for its news activity – para 5

*Legitimate interests of organisations – Part 3
Legitimate interests (general) – Part 3 para 1
- CUD of data permitted where:
o It is in the legitimate interests of the organisation or another person; and
o The legitimate interests outweigh any adverse effect on the individual 
- The org must: Part 3 para 1(2)
o Conduct an assessment before CUD of PD, to determine whether (1) is satisfied 
o Provide the individual with reasonable access to information about the org’s CUD of PD, in accordance with (1).
- For the assessment, the org must: Part 3 para 1(3)
o Identify any adverse effect that the proposed CUD is likely to have on the individual
o Identify and implement reasonable measures:
* To eliminate the adverse effect;
* To reduce the likelihood that the adverse effect will occur; or
* To mitigate the adverse effect 

Other exemptions under Legitimate Interests 
- Evaluative purposes: CUD is necessary for evaluative purposes – para 2 
- Investigation or proceedings: CUD is necessary for investigation or proceedings – para 3 
- Debt: CUD is necessary for org to recover debt owed by individual to org, or to pay debt owed by org to individual – para 4
- Legal services: CUD is necessary for the provision of legal services by the org to another person, or for the org to obtain legal services – para 5
- CUD is necessary for preparation by credit bureau of credit report – para 6 --> but this exemption does NOT apply where the credit bureau is required to hold a licence under any other written law
- CUD is required to confer an interest or benefit on the individual under a private trust or benefit plan, or administer that plan – para 7
- PD is provided by another individual to enable the org to provide a service for the personal or domestic purposes of that individual, and is CUD solely for this purpose – para 8
- Business, employment or professional settings: PD is included in a document produced in the course of and for the purposes of an individual’s employment, business or profession, and is CUD for purposes for which the document was produced – para 9 
o Rationale – Driven by business efficacy reasons – orgs need not worry about day-to-day document creation processes that include personal data of employees 
o E.g. renting retail space, the emails and stuff relating to leasing of premises can all be CUD without consent, as long as the purpose of CUD is consistent with the purposes of leasing the premises 
o Gap in legislation – does not provide for documents that were generated prior to commencement of PDPA – doesn’t provide that such documents can be “collected” even though they can be used and disclosed without consent
- Employment context: CUD is reasonably collected for the purpose of or in relation to the organization: - para 10
o Entering into an employment relationship with the individual or appointing the individual to any office; or
o Managing or terminating the employment relationship with or appointment of the individual

*Business asset transactions – Part 4
Allows CUD without consent of personal data of employees, customers, directors, officers or shareholders in a business asset transaction 
- Business asset transaction – purchase/sale/lease/merger/amalgamation/disposal/financing etc. of an organisation, or an interest in an organisation, or any of the business of the organisation
- The PD must relate directly to the asset in question (of the counterparty) and must be necessary for the organisation to determine whether to proceed with the business asset transaction 
- Where X is a prospective party to the business asset transaction – para 1(3):
o X may collect, and Y may disclose, only PD that is necessary for X to determine whether to proceed with the business asset transaction 
o X and Y must have entered into an agreement that requires X to use or disclose the PD solely for purposes related to the business asset transaction 
- Also applies to CUD of data of individuals belonging to a 3p org, in situations where an interest in the 3p org is being transacted 

Has a clearly defined life cycle and the only instance in the Act that requires PD to be destroyed or returned 
- If the transaction does not proceed, all data must be destroyed or returned to the disclosing organization – para 1(5) 
- If the transaction does proceed, all individuals whose data has been disclosed must be notified that the transaction has taken place and that their data has been disclosed. Excess personal data must be destroyed or returned 
o If X enters into the business transaction with Y – para 1(4): 
* X may use or disclose the PD collected from Y only for the same purposes for which Y would have been permitted to use or disclose the PD 	
* Any data collected from Y which does not relate directly to the part of Y’s business assets with which the business asset transaction entered into is concerned, X must destroy or return to Y that personal data 
* X or Y must notify the applicable individuals of Y whose PD is disclosed that: (i) the business asset transaction has taken place, and (ii) the personal data about them has been disclosed to X

*Business improvement purposes – Part 5 
PDPA First Schedule, Part 5 – permits CUD without consent for any of the following relevant purposes: 
(2) Relevant purposes (where organisation X uses data, or where related corporation Y discloses data to X): 
(a) Product R&D – Improving or enhancing goods/services, or developing new goods/services 
(b) Process R&D – Improving or enhancing methods or processes, or developing new ones

Limitations – applies only if (subparas (3) and (4)):
(a) The relevant purpose reasonably cannot be achieved without the CUD of the PD in an individually identifiable form 
(b) A reasonable person would consider the collection or disclosure of PD about P to be appropriate in the circumstances; and
(c) (If there is disclosure or collection) X and Y are bound by contract/agreement/corporate rules requiring the recipient of PD about P to implement and maintain appropriate safeguards for the PD 

Any PD collected under this ground CANNOT be used for advertising – para 1(6)

Business improvement - USE
Summary 
- Organization doesn’t need consent to use information for business improvement purposes, like improving products or methods 
- BUT ONLY insofar as the organization cannot achieve these purposes with anonymized data, AND the use is objectively reasonable/appropriate. 
--> i.e. if purposes can be achieved with anonymised data, then this exception does NOT apply and consent is required
- Such PD CANNOT be used for advertising 
- NB: normal incorporated companies are excluded from using this exemption

Part 2 Division 2 – Business improvement (for use of information)
1.—(1) Subject to the conditions in sub-paragraph (2), personal data about an individual (P) is used by the organisation for any of the following purposes:
(a) improving or enhancing any goods or services provided, or developing new goods or services to be provided, by the organisation;
(b) improving or enhancing the methods or processes, or developing new methods or processes, for the operations of the organisation;
(c) learning about and understanding the behaviour and preferences of P or another individual in relation to the goods or services provided by the organisation;
(d) identifying any goods or services provided by the organisation that may be suitable for P or another individual, or personalising or customising any such goods or services for P or another individual.

(2) Sub-paragraph (1) applies only if —
(a) the purpose for which the organisation uses personal data about P cannot reasonably be achieved without the use of the personal data in an individually identifiable form; and
(b) a reasonable person would consider the use of personal data about P for that purpose to be appropriate in the circumstances.

(3) To avoid doubt, sub-paragraph (1) does not apply to the use of personal data about P for the purpose of sending to P or another individual a message for an applicable purpose within the meaning given by section 37(6).
- Note – “applicable purpose” is defined in the Tenth Schedule and basically encompasses all kinds of advertising

(4) In this paragraph, “organisation” excludes a corporation within the meaning given by section 4(1) of the Companies Act.
- IMPORTANT – normal incorporated companies are excluded 
Research – USE / DISCLOSURE
Part 2 Division 3 – Research (for use of information)
1. The use of personal data about an individual for a research purpose (including historical or statistical research), if —
(a) the research purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the personal data is used in an individually identifiable form;
(b) there is a clear public benefit to using the personal data for the research purpose;
(c) the results of the research will not be used to make any decision that affects the individual; and
(d) in the event that the results of the research are published, the organisation publishes the results in a form that does not identify the individual.

THESE ARE CUMULATIVE REQUIREMENTS Part 3 Division 2 – Research (for disclosure of information)
1. The disclosure of personal data about an individual for a research purpose (including historical or statistical research), if —

(a) the research purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the personal data is disclosed in an individually identifiable form;

(c) there is a clear public benefit to disclosing the personal data for the research purpose;
(d) the results of the research will not be used to make a decision that affects the individual; and
(e)	in the event that the results of the research are published, the organisation publishes the results in a form that does not identify the individual.
Commentary on new exceptions:
- Research exemption only applies to collection and use	
o Disclosure is provided for in the Fourth Schedule – no disclosure can be made until the recipient org has signed an agreement to comply with the PDPA as well as the policies and procedures relating to the confidentiality of personal data of the disclosing org 


CONCEPTUAL
Consent in practice – rationales: Yip Man, Understanding the Consent Obligation 
- An overemphasis on autonomous authorization will lead to an overload of consent transactions, with the consequence that consumers suffer from “consent fatigue” and “consent desensitization”, thereby weakening the consent mechanism as an effective way of seeking voluntary, intentional and informed authorization 
- Alternatives have been proposed – paternalism, making privacy notices more reasonable and accessible, and a differentiated consent model where the type of consent is based on the severity of risk associated with the particular kind of transaction 
- The role and degree of emphasis of consent within the regulatory framework should be assessed by considering the other interests that are worth protecting
o E.g. higher compliance costs, slower transaction rates – interests of the organization 
o To give full control to individuals in deciding what happens to their personal data can have a serious impact on the functioning of social and legal relationships 
- 

Deemed consent – Hannah Lim, Data Protection in the Practical Context 
- Should be applied with caution – when there is any doubt, should obtain actual consent from the individual 
- Where there is disclosure required as part of the consent deemed, orgs should ensure the receiving party is aware of the purpose limitations of the data 
- Author hates deemed consent, considers it a step backward. Opens up gaps in personal data, and means that purposes and users of personal data are not properly tracked and difficult to be held accountable 
Deemed consent – seemingly undermines the individual’s control, but in practice is a cost-effective means for the org to obtain authorization – Yip Man 
- Benefits the individual in terms of transactional efficiency, as it reduces consent requests avoids overload of consent transactions 

On the exceptions to the Consent Obligation 
Issues generally – Hannah Lim, Data Protection in the Practical Context 
- Schedules have cumulative effect – collected without consent under 2Sched, can be used without consent for the purposes consistent with the purpose of collection 
- Gap in exemption for personal data that was generated or produced but not disclosed prior to the commencement of the PDPA 
- Can consent be withdrawn for PD CUD without consent under the Scheds? 
o Wording of 16(1) suggests that it is not possible – only given or deemed consent can be withdrawn. Commission statement supports this reading. 
o Individuals have little control over their personal data 

“Interest of the individual” 
- Why not just obtain consent if the collection is clearly in the interest of the individual? 
- Very broad and very silly outcomes if applied literally – I can enter everyone in the country into a lucky draw, since it’s in their interest 

The “publicly available” exemption 
- Floodgates
o Commission statement was not clear on how “publicly available” would be determined by the number of people the personal data is disclosed to 
o Also not clear whether the definition of “publicly available” can be determined by the class of persons who have access to the information 
o Author whines – this is antithetical to good PDP policy because it enables almost every piece of personal data to be transformed into personal data with no restrictions on CUD simply through disclosure to the public 
* The perpetrator would be subject to other laws (confidentiality etc.) but the status of the wrongfully disclosed data may not fall under this exception. More guidance required, none forthcoming. 
* Commission also stated that as long as the PD was publicly available at the point of collection, orgs would be able to use and disclose PD without consent, even if the data is no longer publicly available at the time of use 
- Difficulties with observable personal data 
o “Observed by reasonably expected means”, or “Place that is open to the public”
* Difficult questions – e.g. Commission guidance that interior of a taxi is not public for the duration of the hire, despite being a public space. But if driving through a public park, one’s image through the taxi windows is clearly visible – public or private? 
o Me: this is a stupid distinction – non-public in a taxi refers to the conversations and maybe acts performed in the taxi, since not reasonably accessible to anyone outside the taxi – but one’s image taken from outside the taxi would always be considered public 

*c. Purpose limitation obligation (s 18 PDPA)
Keywords: reasonable, appropriate, lawful, legitimate, relevant

CUD is only permitted: 
- For appropriate purposes (based on reasonable person standard); AND
- Only for the purposes that an individual has been informed of under the Purpose Notification Obligation (if applicable) 
o When is Purpose Notification Obligation not applicable? 
* Where there are exceptions to consent (Schedule 1 and 2), or where consent is deemed (s 15) 

So unnecessary data should NOT be collected

Limitation of purpose and extent
18. An organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes —
(a)that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances; and(b)that the individual has been informed of under section 20, if applicable.
Notes 
- s 20 being the notification of purpose (notification obligation)

*D. DATA MINIMIZATION OBLIGATION
- Not an obligation on its own, but arises from Purpose Limitation
- Requirement to collect relevant personal data 
- Lays the groundwork for good data analysis and decision making 
- Ensures relevant, accurate and complete data is used by organizations 

Applies to data intermediaries – the data controller is responsible for setting out what data the intermediary is allowed to use for which purposes 

*j. Transfer limitation obligation
Prohibition on extraterritorial transfer of PD unless requirements complied with. See below for permitted transfer modes 

S 26 PDPA  
Transfer of personal data outside Singapore
26.—(1)  An organisation shall not transfer any personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with requirements prescribed under this Act to ensure that organisations provide a standard of protection to personal data so transferred that is comparable to the protection under this Act.
(2)  The Commission may, on the application of any organisation, by notice in writing exempt the organisation from any requirement prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) in respect of any transfer of personal data by that organisation.
(3)  An exemption under subsection (2) —
(a)may be granted subject to such conditions as the Commission may specify in writing; and(b)need not be published in the Gazette and may be revoked at any time by the Commission.
(4)  The Commission may at any time add to, vary or revoke any condition imposed under this section.
The foreign data protection standard is widely interpreted – can be set by: 
- Law (e.g. EU) and contract (private contractual clause) 
- Executive arrangements (e.g. EU Adequacy Decision, EU-US “Privacy Shield”) 
- Corporate rules / internal processes (e.g. transfer to affiliated companies, DPIA, Compliance to Accountability) 

PERMITTED TRANSFER MODES – PART 3 PDPR 
Rule 10(1) PDPR – Outward transferor of PD must ensure that: 
- The overseas recipient of PD is bound by legally enforceable obligations (e.g. the law of that country, or a contract with the transferor)
o Legally enforceable obligations (Rule 11 PDPR):
* any contract between organisation transferring data and organisation receiving it;
* any binding corporate rules governing the organisation transferring data and the organisation receiving it; or 
--> may only be used for recipients that are related to the transferring organisation
* any other legally binding instrument.

- That provide a standard of protection of the PD that is at least comparable to that under the PDPA 

Rule 10(2) and (3) PDPR – Rule 10(1) is deemed to be fulfilled if any of the following are true:
- The individual consents to the transfer to that territory, but ONLY if 
o the individual was given a summary of the PD protections they should expect for their data in that country
o The consent was not a condition of providing a product or service, unless reasonably necessary for such provision; and 
o The consent wasn’t obtained by fraud 
- There is deemed consent for transfer to that recipient under s 15(3) to (8) PDPA
- Transfer is necessary for use or disclosure under the First Schedule PDPA (where consent is exempted for specified purposes), and the transferor has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the PD will not be used or disclosed by the recipient for any other purpose 
o Only for consent exemptions under Part 1 (vital interests of individuals) or paragraph 2 of Part 2 (national interest) of the First Schedule to the Act
- The PD is data in transit (defined in s 9 below) --> i.e. data goes through Singapore without being CUD by any organisation other than the transferring organisation or its employee
- The PD is publicly available in Singapore 

Definitions of this Part
9.  In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires —

23.  An organisation shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal data collected by or on behalf of the organisation is accurate and complete, if the personal data —
(a)is likely to be used by the organisation to make a decision that affects the individual to whom the personal data relates; or(b)is likely to be disclosed by the organisation to another organisation.
For specifics on how an org can ensure accuracy of PD under its control, open the PDPC Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics, ctrl-f “accuracy” 

*f. Protection obligation (s 24 PDPA) --> also refer to section below wrt protection obligation in context of cybersecurity
Protection of personal data
24.  An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent —
(a)unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal, or similar risks; and(b)the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.
Quick examples 
- Re K Box Entertainment Group – data breach involving disclosure of over 350,000 members’ personal data – caused by weaknesses in the org’s access control (weak password policy), weak control over unused accounts, org’s failure to conduct audits of its security system 
- Re Orchard Turn Developments – unknown perpetrator accessed org’s servers, sent phishing emails to 25k members of the org. The org could not pinpoint the source of the likely leak of credentials or identify the person who accessed the system 

MANAGING INTERMEDIARIES 
Before selecting a data intermediary:
- Orgs should conduct due diligence on proposed DIs to satisfy themselves that the proposed DI is capable of complying with PDPA 
o However, selecting a competent IT vendor is not sufficient to automatically exonerate the org, nor serve as a mitigating factor 
- Should also provide contractual responsibilities, which contain strong PDPA protection for the org. 
o Provisions to clearly set out each org’s responsibilities and liabilities – Re Singhealth 

What is adequate protection? 
- Having proper service agreement with protective obligations – Re CDP and Toh-Shi Printing 
- Having proper processes for secure transfer of PD to the intermediary – Re CDP and Toh-Shi Printing 
- Conducting due diligence to assure itself that intermediary was capable of complying with the PDPA – Re Aviva and Toh-Shi Printing 

Breaches by intermediary -  
- Having only one person perform sensitive handling of PD, because no one to spot errors – Re CDP and Toh-Shi Printing 
- Breaching protective obligations in contract with data controller – e.g. doing extra sorting that was not included in the contractually-agreed process – Re Aviva and Toh-Shi Printing 

Supervisory role 
- Where data processing activities are conducted by an external vendor, the organisation (data controller) has a supervisory or general role for the protection of the PD, while the DI has a more direct and specific role in the protection of PD, arising from its direct possession of or control over the PD – Re Social Metric 
- Escaping liability for breach – Re Singtel and Tech Mahindra
o Singtel was not in breach: 
* Contract required TM to comply with PDPA 
* SOP required TM to protect PD
* Regular checks and audits on TM’s offsite premises 
* Required TM to confirm its compliance with various security protocols 
o Tech Mahindra was in breach:
* Failed to comply with Singtel’s instructions 
* Did not check that DB script was functioning properly before execution 
* Did not follow its own SOP that provided checks before and after execution of the DB script 
- Similar situation for the Toh-Shi Printing cases – Toh-Shi was in breach but the principal orgs weren’t 

Notes 
- A good proportion of data breaches involve DI (about 25% of published decisions), where the DI either contributed to or was directly responsible for the breach 
- Orgs remain liable for obligations under the PDPA as if they themselves processed the PD. Org needs to ensure that data intermediary has complied with the PDPA – see Re Fu Kwee Kitchen 
o Org and DI can jointly be found liable for the breach. Depending on the facts, either one of them may be found individually liable.
o If the DI advises org about insufficient measures but org refuses to implement more, this could go towards a finding that the DI is less/not culpable for any breach – Re K Box 
- The liability of the main organization depends on whether it implemented sufficient contractual measures for the DI to protect PD, and whether it monitored the DI sufficiently during the engagement 


Intermediary cases
Re CDP and Toh-Shi Printing 

CDP account holders received CDP account statements containing information of other account holders – caused by misalignment of the pages during the sorting process which led to compilation errors of multi-page statements 
- The error was spotted by the Print System Operator, who informed a Fan Fold Operator to throw them away. But the FFO threw away the good copies and mailed out the bad copies  

Toh-Shi was a data intermediary because it was carrying out processing activities on behalf of CDP

CDP not liable – had complied with its obligations 
- CDP contracted Toh-shi for printing services through a service agreement – required Toh-Shi to protect the confidentiality of CDP account holders’ PD and to put in place necessary measures for the data 
- CDP had proper processes for the secure transfer of personal data between CDP and Toh-Shi

Toh-Shi liable, had not complied with its obligations 
- The breach occurred as a result of inadequate operational processes in place to ensure that the letters and PD were sent to the correct recipient 
- Only one person was involved in the sorting, thus the documents marked for discarding were instead sent out – having only one person involved in the sorting was insufficient given the nature of the data involved 
- There should have been a better system of checks in place Re Aviva and Toh Shi Printing 

Aviva reported an incident where about 8k policyholders’ PD were erroneously disclosed to other policyholders 
- Toh-Shi sent the UAT to Aviva and got approval. Subsequently further sorted the data in an Excel sheet by postal code, in order to enjoy postage savings. The sort was incomplete and some of the data was jumbled 
- QC Sample checks failed to spot the error because the samples were checked against the incorrectly sorted file instead of the source data from Aviva 

Aviva’s security arrangements
- SOP where Toh-Shi provides sample cases to Aviva for verification and Aviva must sign off on them before Toh-Shi can commence printing the finalized documents 
- Annual inspections and review of Aviva’s arrangement with Toh-Shi to ensure compliance with security procedures etc. 
- Annual on-site inspections 

Toh-Shi’s security arrangements 
- Send user acceptance testing samples to Aviva for verification 
- QC processes and sample checks to ensure accuracy of printed data 
- Once documents are printed, a printout from the mailing machine will record the actual number of letters inserted and tally against the IT report that counts letters computed from the database 
- Printing is done in a secured room with 24/7 CCTV recording. 

Toh-Shi was a data intermediary because it conducted data processing activities on behalf of Aviva 
- This was apparent from the contractual clauses, which stated that Toh-Shi would only process the data for Aviva’s purposes according to Aviva’s instructions 

Aviva had met its protection obligation
- Had adequate security policies, procedures and controls to protect the confidentiality and security of the Aviva policyholders 
- Had also conducted adequate due diligence to assure itself that its data intermediary Toh-Shi was capable of complying with the PDPA 

Toh-Shi had not complied with its protection obligation 
- The error was caused by the further sorting of the data which Aviva had approved, in breach of the SOP 

Cases (from SMU mod)
- Re Social Metric 
o Data intermediary (DI) processed data for the org’s lucky draw 
o The DI didn’t delete the PD after the lucky draw was over 
o The data controller wasn’t in breach because they contracted with the DI that they should delete the data after the event was over 
o Question – contracted to have the data deleted, but did not check or follow up? Cf the Toh-Shi printing cases? 
* A: These kinds of requirements must be decided on a case-by-case basis 
* In social metric case – one-off engagement, not so reasonable to grant audit rights 
* Less sensitive data 
- Re Advanced Home Tutors
o No written instructions – org just asserted that it provided instructions, but no evidence 
o But the instructions that the org asserted did not include any security requirements anyway 
- Re Zero1 – org relied on warranty with regard to data protection, instead of satisfying itself about the intermediary’s ability to protect data 
o Commission noted – Zero1 cited a lack of ability and expertise to audit the DI’s webpage source code as a reason for not conducting audit. But this is not a defence. What is required is not technical oversight but an identification of foreseeable risks, and then requiring the DI to take reasonable measures to address them 
- Prof notes – the intermediaries in the above cases are all either small proprietors or one-man show engineers with no security expertise – they were hired because they were cheap, not because they were good 
- Re K Box – no contractual clauses that required the DI to comply with a standard of protection that was at least comparable to industry standards. 
o “If Finantech had advised K Box on its obligations but K Box had rejected their advice, the Commission could have taken this into account in its assessment of Finantech’s culpability” 
- Re Institution of Engineers Singapore
o Hired big 4 accountancy firms to manage their DP stuff 
o Insufficient to hire big 4 
o In any case, they did not follow some of the recommended actions by the big 4 they hired 
- Re Tiger and SATS 
o See slides to fill facts and main points 
o Where handling data is part of your business, the lack of expertise in how to securely handle data is not a defence 
o APS had relied solely on SATS administrative safeguards and did not implement additional safeguards, procedure or policies of its own 


Preventing accidental disclosure 
Basically establish additional checks at all stages of processing

Things to ensure (according to the PDPC Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure) 
- Ensure destination information is correct 
- Ensure personal data to be sent is correct –
- Ensure only the relevant personal data is disclosed to recipients 
- Ensure correct usage of software – use email autocompletes with caution, or disable them entirely. Or set email delay so that errors can be caught before it’s too late 
- Ensure sensitive personal data is secure when sending 
- Use notices in communications – warn recipients against unauthorized use, retention or disclosure, ask them to delete and inform org if wrong data received 
- Provide regular staff training – prevent reliance on automated systems alone 

Printing processes 
PDPC Guide to Printing Processes for Organizations 
- Sets out guidelines for proper data protection at each stage of printing:
o Setting up 
o Pre-printing – ensure data accuracy through second layer checking, random sampling. Test run the print 
o Printing – supervisory checks – more random sampling 
o Enveloping – more second layer checks – for attachments and return envelopes especially 
o Mailing – only allow authorized personnel to enter mailing room to prevent theft 
o Emailing (via Mail Merge) 
- Key principles
o Segregation of roles of doer and checker to ensure independence of process and make clear what each other’s scope of responsibilities are 
o Competence of the checker – should fully trained on the methods of checking
o Documentary trail of the actions of doer and checker to ensure accountability 
o Intensity and extent of checks should be proportionate to the volume and sensitivity of PD present in the printing process 
o Appropriate juncture for checks – performed at a suitable stage for corrective actions 
o Well-trained employees with clear understanding on the workflow as well as handling of exceptions 
o Contingency plans should be well-documented and communicated in case of a data breach event 
- Outsourcing – key considerations 
o Terms of contract with vendor – should cover: 
* PDPA obligations of print vendor
* Responsibilities of each party during printing process 
* Policies to be implemented by vendor 
* Right of audit/review by org
* Procedures for handling of printing jobs, supervisory checks and disposal of unneeded PD
o How personal data is transferred to the print vendor 
* Ensure emails sent to correct recipient 
* Password protect files 
* Use other electronic means of transfer like SFTP 
* Secure portable media through encryption 
o The print vendor’s processes for checking and ensuring that mailers are sent to correct individuals 
o Conducting checks or audits to ensure print vendor follows correct processes 

Printing processes – cases 
- Many cases – Data Post, two Toh Shi cases, two Aviva cases, NTUC Income, CDP/Toppan, AIG/Toppan, AIA
- Toh Shi and Data Post were particularly egregious because these were specialized in providing printing services to financial institutions 
- Aviva –
o First case – wrong letter into envelope. Responded by implementing checks 
o Second case – a year later, another breach. Found that there were no supervisory checks in place. Staff folded 4 envelopes at once and got the things mixed up 
* Because the department in breach that time was different, so the department in this breach didn’t implement the data protection checks that the department from the first case did 

LEVELS OF PROTECTION 
Physical controls 
- To deter or prevent unauthorized physical access to, and use/disclosure of PD 
- E.g. locking premises and documents, locking doors, keeping personal data in secured medium
- Case – Spear Security – leaving visitor logbook unattended outside the guardhouse. 

Administrative controls 
- Human factors of data protection – all levels of personnel within the org, determine which users have access to which resources and information, what they can do with the information, and consequences for non-compliance 
- E.g. 
o Policies like PDP policy, information policy, data retention policy etc. etc. 
o Confidentiality obligations of employees under NDAs 
o Contracts with data intermediaries requiring compliance with org’s policies and contractual terms supporting the org’s compliance with PDPA 
- Case – SingHealth – failure of the CISO to comply with internal policies 

ELABORATION ON TECHNICAL CONTROLS 
PDPC Guide to Securing PD in Electronic Medium 

Security and data breach risks
Examples of risks 
hacking or other unauthorised access of databases; 
(“ATM”); 
physical attacks such as use of skimming devices on Automated Teller Machine 
malware or hostile programs such as computer viruses and spyware;social engineering, such as phishing scams and the circulation of malware-laden 
email attachments; 
unauthorised access or misuse of personal data by employees or vendors;loss or theft of electronic devices or portable storage devices containing personal 
data; 
fault or weakness in a system’s or device’s program code causing it to reveal personal data to incorrect parties, such as a bug in an online portal allowing 
someone to access another person’s data; 
compromised network devices;compromised point of sales (“POS”) systems;not disposing of electronic personal data properly;unintended disclosure of personal data to another individual other than the 
intended recipient, such as emailing to the wrong recipient.

Governance 
Components of governance that orgs must take into consideration 
- Accountability 
- Standard, policies and procedures 
- Risk management
- Classification and tracking 

Clear accountability 
- Provide clear direction on ICT security goals and policies for personal data protection within the organisation. 
- Identify and empower the person(s) accountable for personal data protection within the organisation. 
 
Standards, policies and procedures 
- Establish and enforce ICT security policies, standards and procedures. 
- Review and update ICT security policies, standards and procedures periodically to ensure relevance.
- Establish end user policies to prevent misuse of ICT systems. 
 
Risk management 
- Institute a risk management framework to identify the security threats to the protection of personal data, assess the risks involved and determine the controls to remove or reduce them. 
- Assess the effectiveness of the risk mitigation controls periodically.  
- Assess the security risks involved in out-sourcing or engaging external parties for ICT services and mitigate them. 
 
Classification and tracking 
- Classify and manage the personal data by considering the potential damage (e.g. reputational or financial) to the individuals involved should the data be compromised.  
- Conduct periodic checks for personal data stored in ICT systems. For personal data that is not required in any form anymore, securely dispose the data (refer to section 8). If there is a need to retain the data but not in identifiable form, e.g. for performing data analytics, consider anonymising2 the data. 
- Conduct physical asset inventory checks regularly to ensure all computers and other electronic devices (e.g. portable hard drive, printer, fax machine etc) used to store or process personal data are accounted for.


Security awareness
Increasing awareness helps reduce the risk of data breaches through system misuse or mistakes
- Example of awareness – being cautious about phishing or other forms of social engineering 
- They should be made aware of the security policies and standards relevant to their work 
- Software developers and ICT personnel should be aware of current and emerging ICT threats, in order to design systems capable of protecting PD

Security awareness – good practices
- Educate employees on ICT security threats and protection measures for personal data. This includes the org’s ICT security policies, standards and procedures 
- Keep ICT security awareness training for employees updated and conduct such training regularly 


Compliance, testing and audits 
Regular assurance checks ensures that security controls are properly implemented and practiced 

Good practices
- Conduct regular ICT security audits, scans and test to detect vulnerabilities and non-compliance with organizational standards 
- Apply prompt remedial actions to detect security vulnerabilities and any non-compliance with policies and procedures 
- Implement measures to ensure ICT system logs are viewed regularly for security violations and possible breaches 


Authentication, authorization and passwords 
Principles 
- The strength of authentication (e.g. password requirements or other mechanisms for access to personal data) should depend on the potential damage to the individual (e.g. reputation or finances) if PD is compromised
- Password policies should require changes to passwords periodically, and there should be technical mechanisms to enforce the policy in terms of password selection and change 
- More secure auth methods include 2FA 

A brief aside on authentication vs authorization 
- Authentication – “who are you” 
- Authorization – “get off my lawn” 

Authentication – good practices 
- Choose suitable auth method based on risk of damage 
- Determine max allowable login attempts depending on type of data
- Account lockout when max attempts reached to prevent dictionary or brute force attacks 
- Password at least 8 chars long with one alphabetical and one numeric character
- Hide password when typed in (duh) 
- Encrypt password during transmission, encrypt or hash in storage – review encryption/hashing mechanism periodically to ensure that it is recognized in the industry as secure 
- Users required to change passwords regularly – frequency depends on risk of damage 
- Change default passwords to strong ones ASAP 
Authentication – enhanced practices
- Assign unique user ID to individual users 
- Encourage users not to use passwords that can be easily deduced, like birth date or name 
- Users should change system-generated password upon first login
- Discourage users from using the same password across different systems or applications 
- The same password should not be reused in the last 3 changes 
- Password comprises both lowercase and uppercase characters 
- Password comprises special characters like “!”, “&” etc. 

Authorization – good practices 
- Implement authorization mechanisms and processes to check if the person accessing the system has the appropriate access rights to the data
- Define user roles or groups for systems that enable access to PD. Review access rights regularly 
- Grant a user only the necessary rights to PD within systems to fulfill their role or function
- Track and review usage of accounts and their associated access rights regularly – remove or change access rights for unused or obsolete accounts promptly 
- Log all successful and failed access to systems to help detect unauthorized attempts to gain access to them 

PDPC GUIDE TO BUILDING WEBSITES FOR SMES 
Orgs should require IT vendors to include security as an important requirement when designing the website

Access control
- Only allow authorized users to access the administrative functions of the site and PD handled by the site 
- The list of authorized admin users should be reviewed and updated regularly to account for resignations, transfers, or changes in job scope 
- Password security requirements – see above
- Lockout users who incorrectly login too many times 
- Passwords should be hashed/encrypted in transmission and storage 
- Dormant user accounts should be suspended 

Audit log
- Logs help to determine the cause of security incidents as well as monitor the overall health of the website 
- Logs should record computer or user events with a timestamp, e.g. 
o System events like startup or shutdown
o Security events like access violations 
o User logins and logouts, including unsuccessful ones 
o Actions performed by users 
- Audit logs take up space and will increase in size over time – orgs need to decide what to log and keep – the system should be designed such that audit logs cannot be modified 
- Audit logs should be regularly reviewed to ensure that there has not been unauthorized activity 

Server and network security
- Install application control (software that only allows authorized applications to work) and updated antivirus software on servers 
- Deploy firewalls and intrusion detection mechanisms on the network 
- Implement HTTPS for all pages that accept user input

Website programming 
- Programmers should be aware of the common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them – OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities is a good guide 
- Orgs should ensure that PD cannot be exposed through such vulnerabilities – website functions must be tested and scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment 
- Orgs should discuss with vendors whether vulnerability scanning is included in their scope ofwh work or procured from another service provider 

GUIDE TO DISPOSAL
Guide to Disposal of Personal Data on Physical Medium 
- Common acceptable means 
o Incineration
o Shredding in such a way that makes it reasonably difficult or impossible in order to reconstruct the information 
* PDPC prefers this to shredding because it’s more environmentally friendly
o Pulping – mixing with water and chemicals before processing into recycled paper 
- Shredding
o Must use the appropriate level of shredder – straight-cut shredders can still allow a 3p to reassemble the doc 
o Cross-cutting or confetti shredders work well 
o Categorized into 7 levels according to DIN standard, a measure of particle size after shredding 
- Typical disposal mistakes
o Common to neglect PD where it is only part of a whole data set, there are mistakes in some fields (and therefore data is deemed inaccurate) or it contains printing errors 
o Paper docs slated for disposal are commonly considered “valueless” and are not secured properly while awaiting destruction 
o Etc. 
- Good practices
o When in doubt whether the paper document contains PD, shred it
o Encourage staff to shred paper documents containing PD regularly to cultivate the habit 
- Brief everyone at every level of seniority on the proper way to deal with PD documents from creation to disposal 
- Outsourcing disposal of paper documents
o Accountability and responsibility to ensure that PD is destroyed remains with the org – contracts must contain the necessary terms and conditions to comply with the PDPA obligations 
o Orgs need to understand the process by which PD is destroyed – whether the 3p does it itself, or there are subcontractors involved, the measures the 3p takes to protect the data/prevent access
o Check whether the data is sent overseas – must comply with Transfer Limitation Obligation 

Guide to Securing PD in Electronic Medium 
- Orgs should ensure that deletion is done in a manner that data cannot be recovered or disclosed. Or can also anonymize data. 
- Electronic storage media (HDDs, SSDs, USB drives, DVD, CD) – when computer equipment is disposed of, these are often returned to the vendor, sold to a 3p or thrown away. Risk of unauthorized disclosure of PD 
- Common deletion not enough, data remains on drive. Secure deletion required via overwriting the selected file, multiple passes required to ensure thorough deletion 
o Overwriting standards are available 
- Sometimes simple overwriting is insufficient – for magnetic storage media, degaussing (removal of magnetic fields) is also available. Physical methods like drilling holes, crushing and shredding the HDD. 

*h. Retention limitation obligation 
RETENTION OF PD
When retention is not necessary or purpose for collection is no longer applicable, the organization must cease to retain the PD, or anonymize it. 

Retention of personal data
25.  An organisation shall cease to retain its documents containing personal data, or remove the means by which the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that —
(a)the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal data; and(b)retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
“As soon as it is reasonable to assume that” 
- The purpose for which the data is collected is “no longer being served”, and
- The retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes 

Common business purposes 
- Retaining customer data for analytics etc. beyond sales
o Customers need to be made aware of these purposes 
- Providing warranty (lifetime warranty?) – but just the information you need to contact the person 
o Purpose limitation obligation still applies 
- Blacklisting clients or people?
o E.g. kiasuparents blacklist of tutors – this was in personal/domestic capacity
o Some tuition agencies keep their own blacklist of tutors or parents – prof says this is probably not perpetual, but maybe for a good amount of time (5-7 years?)

Not allowed – keeping data “just in case”  

Retention period? 
How long personal data can be retained 
- No fixed duration of time 
- General principle – cannot retain PD in perpetuity where it does not have legal or business reasons to do so 
- Duration of time for which an org can legitimately retain PD is assessed on a standard of reasonableness, having regard to the purposes for which the PD was collected and other legal or business purposes for which retention of PD may be necessary
- But the org must comply with any legal or specific industry-standard requirements that may apply 

Acceptable retention period depends on the following factors:
- Purpose for which the PD was collected
o PD can be retained as long as one or more of the purposes for which it was collected remains valid 
o PD must not be kept “just in case” it may be needed for other purposes that have not been notified to the individual 
- Other legal or business purposes for which the retention of PD by the org is necessary – e.g.:
o PD is required for ongoing legal action involving the org (e.g. up to 7 years from termination of a contract, applying the relevant 6-year limitation period)
o Retention of PD is necessary in order to comply with the org’s obligations under laws, regulations etc. 
o PD is necessary for org to carry out its business operations, e.g. to generate annual reports or forecasts 
o Business development purposes like learning and understanding the behaviour and preferences of customers 
o Research, archival, historical, artistic or literary purposes that benefit the wider public or a segment of the public 

Practical recommendations by PDPC 
Practical recommendations for orgs by PDPC Advisory Guidelines: 
- Organizations should review PD that they hold on a regular basis to determine if they are still needed. IF an org holds different types of PD, may have to implement varying retention periods for each type of data
- Orgs should develop or adjust processes to ensure that PD is recorded and stored in a manner which facilitates the org’s compliance with the Retention Limitation Obligation. The org is allowed to have retention policies which are applied to groups or batches of PD 
- Orgs should develop a retention policy as good practice – where data is retained for a long time, org should set out its rationale for doing so in its retention policy 

Disposal of personal data 
Possible ways to get rid of data: 
- Cease to retain – remove possession and control by returning, transferring or destroying the data 
- Remove the means of association – e.g. delinking or anonymization 

What is NOT ceasing to retain PD:
- Merely filing the documents in a locked cabinet 
- Warehouse the documents
- Transferring the docs to a party who is subject to the org’s control in relation to the documents 
- PD in electronic form which are archived or to which access is limited will still be considered to be retained for the purposes of Retention Limitation Obligation

Factors relevant to whether an org has ceased to retain PD 
- Whether the org has any intention to use or access the PD 
- How much effort and resources the org would need to expend in order to use or access the PD again 
- Whether any 3ps have bene given access to that PD 
- Whether the org has made a reasonable attempt to destroy, disposed of or delete the PD in a permanent and complete manner 

*g. Data Breach Notification Obligation --> refer to DBNO below for more details wrt cybersecurity
Part VIA (passed 2020) 

A not-very-useful timeline:


Relevant provisions 
- s 26B – Notifiable data breaches 
- s 26C – Duty to conduct assessment of data breach 
- s 26D – Duty to notify occurrence of notifiable breach 

Flow: Suspect breach --> conduct assessment --> If assessed notifiable, notify asap. 

DUTY TO CONDUCT ASSESSMENT OF DATA BREACH 
For data controllers: 
- Obligation is triggered upon having reason to believe that a data breach has occurred (relating to PD in its possession or control) 
- Organization must immediately conduct an impact assessment 

For data intermediaries: 
- Obligation is triggered upon having reason to believe that a data breach has occurred (relating to PD in its possession or control) 
- Organization must immediately conduct an impact assessment 
- Organization must immediately notify the data controller of the breach 

Duty to conduct assessment of data breach
26C.—(1)  This section applies to a data breach that occurs on or after the date of commencement of section 13 of the Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2020.
(2)  Subject to subsection (3), where an organisation has reason to believe that a data breach affecting personal data in its possession or under its control has occurred, the organisation must conduct, in a reasonable and expeditious manner, an assessment of whether the data breach is a notifiable data breach.
(3)  Where a data intermediary (other than a data intermediary mentioned in section 26E) has reason to believe that a data breach has occurred in relation to personal data that the data intermediary is processing on behalf of and for the purposes of another organisation —
(a)the data intermediary must, without undue delay, notify that other organisation of the occurrence of the data breach; and(b)that other organisation must, upon notification by the data intermediary, conduct an assessment of whether the data breach is a notifiable data breach.
(4)  The organisation must carry out the assessment mentioned in subsection (2) or (3)(b) in accordance with any prescribed requirements.
What is a notifiable data breach? 
Significant harm
TLDR – Significant harm results when:
- Critical information is leaked – full name, NRIC, financial data etc. (see reg 3(1)(a) and Schedule to DBNR) 
- OR when an account number and password/PIN/etc. is leaked (of any account, not just bank account)


s 3(1) Personal Data Protection (Notification of Data Breaches) Regulations 2021 – a data breach is deemed to result in significant harm if the breach relates to:
- The individual’s full name or alias or identification number – 3(1)(a)
o Or any of the other PD in Part 1 of the Schedule 
- Or all of the following:
o The individual’s account identifier – 3(1)(b)(i)
o Any password, security code, response to security question etc. that is used to allow access to or use of the individual’s account – 3(1)(b)(ii) 

Schedule

- Excludes PD that is publicly available (and not publicly available solely because of a data breach) 
- Excludes PD that is disclosed to the extent that it is required or permitted under written law 

Significant scale 
Prescribed number of affected individuals is 500 – s 4 PDP(NoDB)R 

Notifiable data breaches
26B.—(1)  A data breach is a notifiable data breach if the data breach —
(a)results in, or is likely to result in, significant harm to an affected individual; or(b)is, or is likely to be, of a significant scale.
(2)  Without limiting subsection (1)(a), a data breach is deemed to result in significant harm to an individual —
(a)if the data breach is in relation to any prescribed personal data or class of personal data relating to the individual; or(b)in other prescribed circumstances.
(3)  Without limiting subsection (1)(b), a data breach is deemed to be of a significant scale —
(a)if the data breach affects not fewer than the prescribed number of affected individuals; or(b)in other prescribed circumstances.
(4)  Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), a data breach that relates to the unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying or modification of personal data only within an organisation is deemed not to be a notifiable data breach.
DUTY TO NOTIFY OCCURRENCE OF DATA BREACH
After organisation makes the assessment and determines that the breach is notifiable, it must notify PDPC as soon as practicable, and in any case no more than 3 calendar days after assessment. 

At the same time, must also notify each affected individual, unless exceptions apply 
- Exception – if no significant harm is likely to result, due to 
o Remedial action after the breach; or 
o Technical protective measures implemented prior to the breach 

Duty to notify occurrence of notifiable data breach
26D.—(1)  Where an organisation assesses, in accordance with section 26C, that a data breach is a notifiable data breach, the organisation must notify the Commission as soon as is practicable, but in any case no later than 3 calendar days after the day the organisation makes that assessment.
(2)  Subject to subsections (5), (6) and (7), on or after notifying the Commission under subsection (1), the organisation must also notify each affected individual affected by a notifiable data breach mentioned in section 26B(1)(a) in any manner that is reasonable in the circumstances.
(3)  The notification under subsection (1) or (2) must contain, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the organisation at the time it notifies the Commission or affected individual (as the case may be), all the information that is prescribed for this purpose.
(4)  The notification under subsection (1) must be made in the form and submitted in the manner required by the Commission.
(5)  Subsection (2) does not apply to an organisation in relation to an affected individual if the organisation —
(a)on or after assessing that the data breach is a notifiable data breach, takes any action, in accordance with any prescribed requirements, that renders it unlikely that the notifiable data breach will result in significant harm to the affected individual; or(b)had implemented, prior to the occurrence of the notifiable data breach, any technological measure that renders it unlikely that the notifiable data breach will result in significant harm to the affected individual.
(6)  An organisation must not notify any affected individual in accordance with subsection (2) if —
(a)a prescribed law enforcement agency so instructs; or(b)the Commission so directs.
(7)  The Commission may, on the written application of an organisation, waive the requirement to notify an affected individual under subsection (2) subject to any conditions that the Commission thinks fit.
(8)  An organisation is not, by reason only of notifying the Commission under subsection (1) or an affected individual under subsection (2), to be regarded as being in breach of —
(a)any duty or obligation under any written law or rule of law, or any contract, as to secrecy or other restriction on the disclosure of information; or(b)any rule of professional conduct applicable to the organisation.
(9)  Subsections (1) and (2) apply concurrently with any obligation of the organisation under any other written law to notify any other person (including any public agency) of the occurrence of a data breach, or to provide any information relating to a data breach.
Exemptions to notification 
Notification to affected individual is not required if remedial action is taken to reduce the risk of significant harm, or personal data was encrypted to a reasonable standard – s 26D(5)(a) and (b)
- NOTE – NOTIFICATION TO PDPA ALWAYS REQUIRED 

Remedial action exemption – where organizations have taken remedial actions to reduce likely harm or impact to the affected individuals such that the data breach is unlikely to result in significant harm to them 

Technological protection exemption – where the PD that was compromised by the data breach is subject to technological protection (e.g. encryption) that is of a reasonable security standard, such that the data breach is unlikely to result in significant harm to the affected individuals 

Orgs must also not notify affected individuals if instructed by a prescribed law enforcement agency or directed by PDPC 
- Rationale – to cater to situations where notification may compromise investigations or prejudice enforcement efforts 

CONCEPTUAL 
Other notification requirements 
Cybersecurity Act 
Org has the obligation to report to the CSA – s 14(a) Cybersecurity Act
(a) A prescribed cybersecurity incident in respect of the CII 
(b) A prescribed cybersecurity incident in respect of any computer or computer system that is interconnected with or that communicates with the CII 
(c) Any other type of cybersecurity incident in respect of the CII that the Commissioner of the CSA has specified by written direction to the org 
Owner can be fined $100,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years for non-performance – s 12(6) CSA 

*k. Accountability (s 11-12 PDPA)
This is an overriding idea that applies to compliance with the other obligations 

- Two key elements: 
o Responsibility for personal data in their possession or under their control (s 11(2) PDPA)
o Being able to demonstrate how the organisation has discharged its responsibility under the PDPA

- May include:
o Measures specified in the PDPA (e.g. appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO), develop data protection policies and practices)
o Measures not specified in PDPA but required to comply with the Data Protection Provisions (e.g. conduct a data inventory) 
* Some are not required under the PDPA, but may still be needed for compliance. May be mentioned in the PDPC Guidelines 
* PDPC has given guidance on developing a Data Protection Management Programme (DPMP) and related documents and practices (not covered in this unit)

Specific provisions 
- S 11(2) PDPA – an organization is responsible for PD in its possession and control 
- S 11(3) PDPA – requirement to have a DPO to be responsible for ensuring organisation complies with PDPA
- S 12(a) PDPA – requirement to develop and implement policies and practices necessary for organisation to meet its PDPA obligations 
o Demonstrates accountability to external parties by informing them of the ways in which the DPO handles personal data
- S 12(b) PDPA – develop a process to receive and respond to complaints that may arise with respect to the application of this Act
- S 12(c) PDPA – communicate to its staff information about the organisation’s policies and practices
- S 12(d) PDPA – make information available on request about (i) the policies and practices and (ii) the complaint process

FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY PRINCIPLE 
General 
- Academic opinion that traditional approaches to DP (trying to keep data within certain boundaries, drawn at the point when the data was first collected) are no longer effective. Data controllers who respect the consent boundaries find themselves disadvantaged and unable to use data for unanticipated purposes. Those who don’t, make a mockery of consent. 
- “Consent fatigue” – it is no longer practical to require consumers to give consent to every instance of data collection. Consent fatigue has been blamed for consumers’ behavior of clicking through terms of use/privacy policies without reading them.
- Weitzner et al suggested that the need for consumers to be informed is misplaced. Should instead give access to redress instead, according to the accountability principle. 
o Privacy by design – building it into our systems and processes, instead of bolting it on as an add-on 

The Galway Project: 
- Accountability requires that orgs take responsibility for its protection and appropriate use, beyond mere legal requirements, and they are accountable for any misuse of the information that is in their care 
- This principle does not redefine privacy or replace existing law or regulation – just shifts the focus of privacy governance to an org’s ability to demonstrate its capacity to achieve specified objectives 
- 5 essential elements of an accountability approach
o Organizational commitment to accountability and adoption of internal policies consistent with external criteria 
o Mechanisms to put privacy policies into effect, including tools, training and education – DPO, DPMP
o Systems for internal, ongoing oversight and assurance reviews and external verification 
o Transparency and mechanisms for individual participation 
o Means for remediation and external enforcement 
- Elaborations 
o Proactive in nature, goes beyond compliance 
o Data controller ought to answer and provide an account to regulators and individuals when data breach occurs 

Under the PDPA 
Not an explicit principle, put the accountability principle is embedded in in the substantive obligations of the PDPA 
- Model Code before the PDPA made explicit reference to accountability 
- Model Code also had these features of accountability which were brought over to the PDPA 
o Designation of a person who is accountable for the org’s compliance 
o Obligation on the org to ensure that in transfers, the recipient would process data consistently with the Model Code
o Required org to implement policies and procedures to give effect to the principles 
- Identification of to whom the data controller is answerable in the Commission’s Key Concepts Guidelines – org is answerable to data subjects and the Commission 
- Flexibility (a feature of the accountability principle) granted to orgs in cross-border transfers – no hard requirements or stipulated contractual clauses, orgs are given the freedom to impose obligations on foreign recipients of personal data 

PDPC is shifting towards accountability: 
- Trustmark Certification Program, DPO Certification, DPMP, Privacy by Design, DPIA, rules on managing data breaches 

ACCOUNTABILITY IN PRACTICE 
Data protection officers – mandatory under s 11(3)

Policies and practices
- Statutory obligation to implement policies and practices necessary to meet obligations under the PDPA 
- This obligation has been subject to enforcement by the Commission 

Data Protection Management Programme 
- DPMP Guide sets out a comprehensive approach to designing, implementing or administering a DPMP 
- The implementation of a DPMP evinces accountability to regulators 
- DPMP functions as risk identification and management 
o Risk of policies becoming outdated 
o Risk introduced when products or policies undergo changes 
o Risk of data breaches through the establishment of procedures for effective management and reporting of data breaches 

Mechanisms to put privacy policies into effect, including tools, training and education 
- This looks like “privacy by design” – implementation of processes and training etc. 
- Staff training (an important aspect of accountability) – under PDPA, orgs have to “communicate to its staff information about the org’s policies and practices”. 

Systems for internal, ongoing oversight, internal assurance reviews and external verification
- WP29 recommends implementing procedures to ensure that measures work not only in paper but also in practice 
- Can take the form of internal audits 

Transparency and mechanisms for individual participation
- PDPA – express obligation for an org to make information available on request about its policies and practices and its complaint process (the openness obligation)
- Also obligation to provide the business contact info of the DPO, who should be readily accessible from Singapore during business hours 
- This author thinks that consent is not eclipsed despite the PDPA anticipating situations where consent is not required – privacy notice forms the basis of consent etc. etc. 
- Access and correction obligations – accountability to individuals 
- Retention limitation obligation 

Means for remediation and external enforcement
- Organizations must anticipate failures of policies and practices – must provide for a recourse mechanism to deal with individuals harmed by such failures 
- Under PDPA, org has to “develop a process to receive and respond to complaints that may arise with respect to the application of [the PDPA]”. 
- PDPA also empowers the Commission to refer any complaint to mediation’

Notes on specified message
- These categories are open and can be expanded to include messages with some purpose other than marketing in the future – MICA, in a PDP Bill consultation 


The “sender” 
s 38 PDPA 
This Part shall apply to a specified message addressed to a Singapore telephone number where – 
(a) the sender of the specified message is present in Singapore when the specified message is sent; or 
(b) the recipient of the specified message is present in Singapore when the specified message is sent. 

Notes on the sender
- The scope of the DNC regime is defined by the nature of the message rather than the originating party
- The jurisdiction provision (s 38) requires that either the sender or the recipient is within jurisdiction when the message is sent 
- The “sender” includes both the creator of the message as well as intermediaries such as an agent or contractor 
- The duty to complies lies on the “person” (as opposed to the “organization”) – every link in the chain that pushes information to an individual must comply with his duty 
- Authorization of messages 
o 37(3) PDPA – a person who authorizes another person to offer, advertise or promote the first person’s goods, services, land, interest or opportunity shall be deemed to have authorized the sending of any message sent by the second person that offers, advertises or promotes that first person’s goods, services, land, interest or opportunity. 
- Exemptions – 
o Exemption from criminal liability an employee acting on good faith in the course of his employment or only in accordance with the instructions that originate from an employer 
o Telecommunications service provider, one that merely provides a service that enables a specified message to be sent, shall be presumed not to have sent the message or to have authorized it to be sent 

Practical compliance 
Compliance – a filtering approach 
- Sender is required to check the Registry within a “prescribed duration” of sending messages, and receive confirmation that the number is not listed before doing so 
- Duty to check the register lies on the sender; not a duty to unsubscribe placed on the recipient as in the Spam Control Act 
- Failure to comply is an offence, up to $10,000 fine.

Contact information, calling line identity 
- Senders are required to include in their message “clear and accurate information identifying the individual or organization who sent or authorized the sending of the specified message” – 44(1)(a) PDPA 
- Senders must provide contact information for recipients to reach them – 44(1)(b)
- Sender is required to display the originating number of the call – 45(1)(a)
o Senders are not allowed to use any methods or seek assistance in concealing or withholding from the recipient the calling line identity of the sender (presumably prohibits applying for private line services from telephone companies)


EXCEPTIONS 
Consent – the opt-in mechanism 
Consent 
s 43(3) – It is a defence to the offence of not checking the register for a sender if it can be shown that the recipient gave clear and unambiguous consent to the sending of the specified message to the Singapore phone number 
- Requirement – opt-in must be manifested in the form of “clear and unambiguous” consent, and consent must be recorded in written or other form so as to be accessible for subsequent reference 
- Consent should not be obtained as a condition for the provision of goods or services if it is not reasonably required for such provision – s 46(1) 
- Consent obtained by the provision of false or misleading information or through the use of deceptive or misleading practices is not recognized as valid – s 46(2)
- Consent can be withdrawn, and withdrawal has prospective effect – ss 47(1)-(3) and 47(6). 
- Grandfathering clause – Consent given before Part IX came into force is deemed to be valid, even if the phone number was subsequently registered in the Registry – s 47(4) 

“Ongoing relationship” exception 
Pursuant to the Personal Data Protection (Exemption from section 43) Order 2013 (the “EO”)

Definition of “ongoing relationship” 
- Based on a pre-existing transaction arising from the carrying on or conduct of a business or activity between the sender and the recipient in question 
- Sender can send messages to persons with whom he has an ongoing relationship at the time of transmission, provided the purpose of the message is related to the subject of the ongoing relationship  
- Subscriber can withdraw consent specifically. 

Conditions for exception 
- The message is a text message or fax message 
- There is an “Ongoing relationship” and the message is related to it 
- Exempt message must come with a statement informing the recipient of the right to opt out of future messages from the sender – Para 4(a) of the EO 
- Sender must provide a fully-functioning opt-out facility with each exempt message, via Singapore telephone number or short code, or fax number – Para 4(b) EO 
- Facility should be user-friendly and not cost prohibitive – Para 4(c) EO 

Notes
- The reasonableness test under s 11 applies here. 
- A message is more likely to be reasonable if the information is of benefit to the recipient, e.g. if it facilitates the individuals’ utilization of the goods and services purchased through the ongoing relationship or their utilization of a membership – PDPC Advisory Guidelines on the DNC Provisions

Banter 
- Rationale – to alleviate the burden on businesses, benefit consumers by giving them access to information which is likely to be of interest of them 
- Acknowledges the difference between text messages and calls, where calls are seen as more invasive and costly 
- “Ongoing relationship” can be seen as being consistent with the consent provisions 


CONCEPTUAL 
- DNC List is a compromise between the “opt-out” and “opt-in” approaches – allows users to use the opt-out procedure, while permitting specific opt-in as an exception for commercial outreach of businesses 
- The type of messages the DNC applies to – sent to phone numbers
o Subject matter of specified message – similar to SCA in that they’re mostly commercial message 
o Cf SCA – electronic messages
- Sender must check the Register regularly
- Other conditions for sending
o Must provide sender contact information 
o Must not obscure calling line identity 
- Exemptions 
o Specific opt-in via consent 
o Ongoing relationships – sender must prove that service/transaction has not ended with consumer, can continue sending even if the recipient’s phone number is on the register 
o Messages sent with the sole purpose of market research etc. 
o Messages sent to an organization other than an individual (B2B communications are allowed) – bearing in mind the PDPA is about personal interests 
- Uses “person” instead of “organization” – significance? 
o Applies to data intermediaries as well 
o Telemarketers, insofar as they collect and process data on behalf of another organization, they are data intermediaries for the purpose of data protection. Thus only subject to security and retention obligations. But insofar as they use the phone numbers and contact people on behalf of organizations, they are considered persons under the DNC regime, and need to comply. 
* Thus no relevance under DNC to the data intermediary  



*Part C: Rights of individuals – overview 
Organisations must give effect to rights on individuals under the PDPA 
- Depends on exercise of the right by the individual concerned
- Main rights:
a. Right to Withdraw Consent
b. Right of Access – see also PDPC’s Access and Correction Obligation
c. Right of Correction – see also PDPC’s Access and Correction Obligation
d. Right to Data Portability – PDPC’s Data Portability Obligation (NOT YET IN FORCE SO NOT COVERED)
e. Right of private action

Rights of Individuals: Highlights 
- Right to Withdraw Consent (s 16 PDPA)
o Organisations must give effect to the withdrawal of consent by an individual (i.e. not allowed to prevent an individual from withdrawing consent), although this does not affect the legal consequences which may arise from a withdrawal 
--> e.g. customer stops giving consent to Telco to use his address for mailing bills, but this does not affect the debt that would be accruing from his phone bills

o Organisations may continue to collect, use and disclose personal data if doing so without consent is required or authorised under written law

- Rights of Access and Correction (s 21-22 PDPA and Part 2 PDPR)
- Right to Data Portability 
o Not yet in force (not covered in this unit)
- Right of Private Action (s 48O PDPA) 
o See Michael Reed v Alex Bellingham [2022] SGCA 60 (Note: This case relates to the former PDPA section on right of private action which was repealed and replaced by section 48O)

*A. RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT (S 16 PDPA)
See above 

Summary 
Section 16 sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with by either the individual or the organisation in relation to a withdrawal of consent. In brief, they are:
a) the individual must give reasonable notice of the withdrawal to the organisation (section 16(1));
b) on receipt of the notice, the organisation must inform the individual of the likely consequences of withdrawing consent (section 16(2));
c) an organisation must not prohibit an individual from withdrawing consent, although this does not affect any legal consequences arising from such withdrawal (section 16(3)); and 
d) upon withdrawal of consent, the organisation must cease (and cause its data intermediaries and agents to cease) collecting, using or disclosing the personal data, as the case may be, unless the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data without consent is required or authorised under the PDPA or any other written law (section 16(4)).

*B. RIGHTS OF ACCESS AND CORRECTION (S 21-22 PDPA, PART 2 PDPR)

*C. RIGHT OF PRIVATE ACTION (S 48O PDPA)
Individual has a right for civil action against an organization that causes loss or damage to him via a breach of PDPA. 

Why did the individual succeed and what is the remedy?
- Individual aggrieved did not lose money but suffered from emotional distress
- Remedy: CA restored the orders made by DJ on the ground that the appellant’s emotional distress is a form of “loss or damage” within s 48O(1) PDPA -  i.e. (i) injunction to restrain the respondent and (ii) an order that the respondent undertakes to destroy the appellant's personal data that was in his possession

Loss or damage includes emotional distress, but not loss of control of PD – Reed, Michael v Bellingham, Alex (Attorney-General, intervener) 
- Can claim on emotional distress alone – Emotional distress can sometimes be the only damage suffered by the applicant, and a claim founded on this alone is still valid 
- Emotional distress must be suffered directly as a result of a contravention of PDPA's provisions 
- Loss or damage suffered must not be trivial

Factors for determining whether there was emotional distress –
* the nature of personal data involved in the breach (some categories of personal data, such as financial data, are likely to be sensitive);
* the nature of the breach (whether the breach of the PDPA was one-off, repeated and/or continuing);
* the nature of the defendant's conduct (whether there was fraudulent or malicious intent);
* risk of future breaches of the PDPA causing emotional distress to the claimant;
* the actual impact of the breach on the claimant.

Right of private action
48O.—(1)  A person who suffers loss or damage directly as a result of a contravention —
(a)by an organisation of any provision of Part 4, 5, 6, 6A or 6B; or(b)by a person of any provision of Division 3 of Part 9 or section 48B(1),
has a right of action for relief in civil proceedings in a court.[40/2020]
(2)  If the Commission has made a decision under this Act in respect of a contravention specified in subsection (1), an action accruing under subsection (1) may not be brought in respect of that contravention until after the decision has become final as a result of there being no further right of appeal.
[40/2020]
(3)  The court may grant to the claimant in an action under subsection (1) all or any of the following:
(a)relief by way of injunction or declaration;(b)damages;(c)any other relief as the court thinks fit.

Reed, Michael v Bellingham, Alex (Attorney-General, intervener) [2022] SGCA 60
This decision clarifies the ambit of the right of private action under the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and sheds light on how the phrase "loss or damage" should be interpreted. 
Credits: Baker McKenzie InsightPlus 

In brief
The Singapore Court of Appeal, in its recent decision of Reed, Michael v Bellingham, Alex (Attorney-General, intervener) [2022] SGCA 60, provides clarity on two provisions under the Personal Data Protection Act ("PDPA"). The first is section 4(1)(b), which states that the PDPA does not impose any obligation on any employee acting in the course of his or her employment with an organisation.

The second is the then section 32 (now section 48O), which allows individuals who suffer loss or damage as a result of an organisation's contravention of the PDPA, the right to commence private action against the organisation.

Key takeaways
There are three main takeaways from this decision.
1. First, section 4(1)(b) is regarded as a defence for employees to prove that he/she engaged in the conduct in good faith during the course of his/her employment. The doctrine of vicarious liability cannot be imported into the section as it is contrary to the effect of section 4(1)(b), which is to exempt the employee from liability.
2. Secondly, the Court made clear that aggrieved individuals can decide between complaining to the Personal Data Protection Commission ("PDPC") and commencing a private action against an organisation that contravenes the PDPA. A complainant need not make a complaint to the PDPC first before litigating under section 32.

3. Thirdly, the Court held that the phrase "loss or damage" includes emotional distress. The emotional distress must be suffered directly as a result of a contravention of PDPA's provisions and the loss or damage suffered must not be trivial.

Even if the loss or damage suffered by the aggrieved individual is confined to emotional distress, the Court recognised that it is common for emotional distress to be the only loss or damage suffered, and individuals may still bring a claim against the organisation.

With aggrieved individuals having more than one avenue against the organisation and given the broad interpretation of "loss or damage", this decision serves as a good reminder to organisations that their liability is fault-based under the PDPA and they are to review their existing data protection policies and measures and ensure compliance with the PDPA. 

In further detail
Background
IP Investment Management Pte Ltd and IP Real Estate Investments Pte Ltd (the "Employers") commenced a private action against their former employee, Alex Bellingham (the "respondent"). Amongst others, they sought to restrain the respondent from using Michael Reed's (the "appellant") and others' personal data. The appellant received an email from the respondent regarding his investment activity in a particular fund, and was surprised how the respondent got hold of his personal email address and was aware of his investment activities.

The District Judge granted the appellant an injunction to restrain the respondent and an order that the respondent undertakes to destroy the appellant's personal data that was in his possession. The respondent subsequently filed an appeal against the District Judge's decision. The High Court judge allowed the appeal and was of the view that neither the loss of control nor personal data and emotional distress are recognised under section 32 of the PDPA.

Issues for determination before the Court of Appeal
It was accepted by both parties that the respondent was in breach of sections 13 and 18 of the PDPA. There were three issues that arose for the Court's determination:
* Whether section 4(1)(b) of the PDPA exempts the respondent from liability for breaching sections 13 and 18;
* Whether "loss or damage" includes emotional distress or loss of control of personal data; and
* Whether the appellant suffered emotional distress or loss of control of personal data.

Section 4(1)(b) does not exempt the respondent from liability 
The Court held that section 4(1) is a defence that may be invoked by a party accused of breaching the PDPA to avoid liability. On the burden of proof, it is for the respondent to show that when the breaches of the PDPA occurred, he was an employee, and was acting in the course of his employment in committing the breach.
However, there was insufficient evidence to prove that the respondent was acting within the course of employment when he misused the personal data.

The Court also expressly declined the importation of the doctrine of vicarious liability into section 4(1)(b) of the PDPA due to the fundamental conceptual incompatibility between the two - an employer's liability under the PDPA is fault-based whereas the doctrine of vicarious liability seeks to hold an employer liable through no fault of its own.

"Loss or damage" includes emotional distress but not loss of control of personal data
The Court adopted a purposive interpretation of section 32(1) of the PDPA (now section 48O(1)) and held that emotional distress can found a section 32 action. In support of this conclusion, the Court first looked to the legislative intent underlying section 32. It held that the parliamentary intention to promote the right of individuals to protect their personal data supersedes the presumptive common law position that emotional distress per se is not actionable.

Adopting a textual and contextual interpretation of the section, there is nothing that militates against the inclusion of emotional distress into the phrase "loss or damage".

The Court acknowledged that it is common for emotional distress to be the only loss or damage suffered when there is a misuse of personal data. It does not matter that Singapore does not expressly recognise a right to privacy as it is "ordinary human experience" that the misuse of personal data will result in distress and anxiety.

The Court also considered the question of whether it will open the floodgates of litigation if "loss or damage" can be interpreted to include emotional distress, and considered the question moot with the following control mechanisms in place:
* the loss or damage must have been suffered directly as a result of the contravention; and
* there is no recourse for minimal loss (the de minimis principle).

However, the loss of control of personal data does not constitute "loss or damage" under section 32. This is because the loss of control of personal data (in one way or another) permeates every contravention of Part 4 to Part 6 of the PDPA. 

The appellant suffered emotional distress
In ascertaining whether there was emotional distress, the inquiry is whether the very individual before the court subjectively suffered emotional distress. That said, the court is still entitled to take into account how a reasonable person would have reacted in similar circumstances to assess the claimant's subjective state of mind.

A multi-factorial approach should be adopted in assessing whether there was emotional distress. To this end, the Court helpfully laid down several non-exhaustive factors to be considered:
* the nature of personal data involved in the breach (some categories of personal data, such as financial data, are likely to be sensitive);
* the nature of the breach (whether the breach of the PDPA was one-off, repeated and/or continuing);
* the nature of the defendant's conduct (whether there was fraudulent or malicious intent);
* risk of future breaches of the PDPA causing emotional distress to the claimant;
* the actual impact of the breach on the claimant.

On the facts, the Court held that the appellant did suffer emotional distress. While the appellant's emails and the language used did not seem to suggest that there was distress, the conduct of both the appellant and the respondent must be taken into account. The appellant brought the issue to the attention of one of the Employers and the Employer was persuaded to demand an undertaking from the respondent to not misuse the personal data, which the respondent had refused to provide. Other factors that the Court took into account include the sensitive nature of the personal data involved and the attitude of the respondent when being confronted about the use of personal data.



*Part D: Enforcement of the PDPA 
PDPC’s Investigative and Enforcement Powers 
- PDPC exercises powers of investigation under s 50 PDPA and various powers of enforcement under Part 9C PDPA

- If it receives a complaint, it might start an investigation into whether an organisation has complied with PDPA. 

- PDPC can also start an investigation on its own.

- Powers of enforcement include:
o Power to refer a complaint to mediation or other modes of alternative dispute resolution
--> Where PDPC has referred a complaint to an organisation, PDPC will generally monitor the progress of discussions between the complainant and the organisation. If necessary, the Commission may facilitate the resolution of the complaint, e.g. PDPC may request DPO of organisation or other appropriate representative to meet with complainant with or without a PDPC member to discuss complainant’s concerns
o Power to review an organisation’s response to an access request or correction request under PDPA 
--> ONLY LIMITED TO ORGANISATION’S REFUSAL TO requests for access to, or correction or porting of, personal data (i.e. not a general power of review, e.g. failure to obtain consent before collecting PD)
--> where individual asked for access but organisation rejected the request. This rejection can be reviewed by PDPC
o Power to issue a direction for non-compliance 
o Power to require payment of a financial penalty of up to 10% of the annual turnover of the organisation in Singapore or $1 million, whichever is higher (for breaches of the Data Protection Provisions) 
o Power to accept a voluntary undertaking (when organisation may have contravened PDPA and decides to offer a voluntary undertaking in lieu of an investigation and enforcement action)

- PDPA includes provisions for reconsideration of, and appeal against, PDPC’s decision (s 48N and Part 9C PDPA) 
--> organisation or person aggrieved by a decision, direction or financial penalty of the PDPC may apply to the PDPC for it to reconsider the decision, direction or financial penalty (application must be made within 28 days from issuance of decision/direction)

NB: PDPC has NO power to review an organisation’s failure to obtain an individual’s consent for CUD of his PD --> PDPC instead encourages self-resolution where aggrieved individual should first approach the organisation
- The mere fact that an individual has not consented to the use of his personal data by an organisation does not indicate that the organisation has breached the PDPA. This is because there are a number of situations where an organisation is permitted to use an individual’s personal data without his consent under the PDPA
- In addition, where an organisation is using an individual’s personal data in accordance with the PDPA and the individual would like the organisation to stop using his personal data, the individual will have to give reasonable notice to the organisation to withdraw his consent. The Commission cannot withdraw consent on behalf of the individual.

POWER TO REVIEW DECISIONS OF ORGANIZATIONS – S 48H 
Summary
- PDPC has power to review various decisions that organizations make with regard to personal data.
- Some types of decisions (the more common ones) 
o Refusal to provide access under s 21 (access obligation) 
o Refusal to correct PD under s 22 (correction obligation)
o Fees charged in order to process a request for either of the above 
- An aggrieved individual starts this process by making a complaint 

NB: *no power to review organisation’s failure to obtain consent for collection of PD

Power to review
48H.—(1)  On the application of a complainant, the Commission may review —
(a)a refusal by an organisation to provide access to personal data or other information requested by the complainant under section 21, or the organisation’s failure to provide that access within a reasonable time;(b)a refusal by an organisation to correct personal data in accordance with a request by the complainant under section 22, or the organisation’s failure to make the correction within a reasonable time;(c)a refusal by a porting organisation to transmit any applicable data pursuant to a data porting request under section 26H, or the porting organisation’s failure to transmit the applicable data within a reasonable time;(d)a fee required from the complainant by an organisation in relation to a request by the complainant under section 21 or 22; or(e)a fee required from the complainant or a receiving organisation by a porting organisation in relation to a data porting request by the complainant under section 26H.
[40/2020]

(a)confirm the refusal to provide access to the personal data or other information, or direct the organisation to provide access to the personal data or other information within the time specified by the Commission;(b)confirm the refusal to correct the personal data, or direct the organisation to correct the personal data in the manner and within the time specified by the Commission;(c)confirm the refusal to transmit the applicable data, or direct the porting organisation to transmit the applicable data in the manner and within the time specified by the Commission; or(d)confirm, reduce or disallow a fee, or direct the organisation or porting organisation (as the case may be) to make a refund to the complainant or receiving organisation, as the case may be.
DIRECTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE – S 48I 
Directions
48I – PDPC may issue directions for non-compliance 

Section 48I(2) of the PDPA further provides that the Commission may (without prejudice to section 48I(1) of the PDPA) give an organisation that is not complying with any Data Protection Provisions, any or all of the following directions:
(a) to stop collecting, using or disclosing personal data in contravention of the PDPA; 
(b) to destroy personal data collected in contravention of the PDPA; or
(c) to comply with any direction of the Commission under section 48H(2) of the PDPA.

Enforcement Guide: In general, the directions that the Commission may give under section 48I of the PDPA are likely to fall within the following types:
- Directions to remedy the organisation’s contravention, that is, by requiring the organisation to take corrective action, for example, by requiring the infringing organisation to cease its use of personal data collected in contravention of the PDPA;
- Directions to prevent or reduce the possibility of harm (or further harm) to individuals who are (or may be) affected by the organisation’s contravention; and 
- Directions to rectify an organisation’s processes, for example, by requiring the infringing organisation to take certain measures so that it will be brought into compliance with the PDPA.

In the event an organisation does not comply with a direction under section 48I of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered under section 48M of the PDPA to enforce the direction by registering it in the District Court. Please refer to section 30 of these Guidelines for more information on the enforcement of the Commission’s directions.

FINANCIAL PENALTIES – S 48J 
48J – Financial penalties 
- Under Section 48J of the PDPA, the Commission may require an organisation to pay a financial penalty of up to S$1 million or 10% of the organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore, whichever is higher, for any intentional or negligent contravention of the Data Protection Provisions.

Financial penalty – factors (mandatory factors under 48J(6))
- The nature, gravity and duration of non-compliance 
- The type and nature of personal data 
- Whether the org gained financial benefit/avoided financial loss as a result of non-compliance 
- Whether org took action to mitigate effects of breach, and the timeliness and effectiveness of such actions
- Org’s existing measures for PD compliance 
- Past breaches of the org
- Compliance with other PDPC directions for the breach 
- Whether financial penalty is proportionate and effective, having regard to achieving compliance and deterring non-compliance 
- The likely effect of the financial penalty on the org, including the ability of the org to continue its usual activities 
- Any other matter that may be relevant 

Employers are liable for acts of employees – s 53(1)
- Any act done or conduct engaged in by a person in the course of his employment (referred to in this section as the employee) shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as done or engaged in by his employer as well as by him, whether or not it was done or engaged in with the employer’s knowledge or approval.
- (2) In any proceedings for an offence under this Act brought against any person in respect of an act or conduct alleged to have been done or engaged in, as the case may be, by an employee of that person, it is a defence for that person to prove that he took such steps as were practicable to prevent the employee from doing the act or engaging in the conduct, or from doing or engaging in, in the course of his employment, acts or conduct, as the case may be, of that description.

REVIEW QUESTIONS 
Part B – could be useful reading, but not directly tested 

How does PDPC exercise its powers of investigation and enforcement? What is its approach to resolving or addressing a complaint? (Hint: See Enforcement Guidelines)
- Upon receiving a complaint, the Commission will first consider whether it may be more appropriately resolved by adopting some or all of the measures described in section 6 of these Guidelines. Where the Commission receives a query or other information concerning an organisation’s compliance with the PDPA, the Commission may also, in appropriate cases, adopt some or all of the measures described in section 6 of these Guidelines to encourage the organisation to take the appropriate action to address the issues raised and ensure its compliance.
- In considering whether to take any of the measures described in section 6 of these Guidelines, the Commission will generally consider the following factors: 
o whether, in the Commission’s view, the issues in the complaint (including the conduct of the organisation that is the subject of the complaint):
* (a) relate solely to the complainant (or whether other individuals may be affected by the organisation’s conduct in question); or
* (b) may be more effectively resolved through discussions between the complainant and the organisation;
o whether the remedies or other corrective action preferred by the complainant:
* (a) are within the Commission’s powers; or
* (b) may be voluntarily provided by the organisation; and
o whether the organisation concerned has the required policies and processes in place to address complaints.
- In the event the complaint is subsequently resolved, the Commission will generally not proceed with an investigation unless the circumstances are such that, in the Commission’s view, an investigation is warranted. For more information on the Commission’s considerations in this regard, please refer to section 16 of these Guidelines

When could PDPC terminate an investigation? 
50 (3) The Commission may suspend, discontinue or refuse to conduct an investigation under this section if it thinks fit, including but not limited to any of the following circumstances:
(a)the complainant has not complied with a direction under section 48G(2);(b)the parties involved in the matter have mutually agreed to settle the matter;(c)any party involved in the matter has commenced legal proceedings against another party in respect of any contravention or alleged contravention of this Act by the other party;(ca)the Commission accepts a voluntary undertaking given by an organisation or a person under section 48L(1) in relation to the matter;(d)the Commission is of the opinion that the matter may be more appropriately investigated by another regulatory authority and has referred the matter to that authority; or(e)the Commission is of the opinion that —
(i)a complaint is frivolous or vexatious or is not made in good faith; or(ii)any other circumstances warrant refusing to conduct, suspending or discontinuing the investigation.
“Any other circumstances” can refer to situations like:
- Company has/is about to permanently cease business in Singapore 
- Other Singapore laws take precedence over PDPA 
- Where the Commissioner deems that the severity of the potential breach does not warrant taking any further action – My Digital Lock 
- Where the subject matter of the complaint is better resolved through the judicial process – My Digital Lock 

Other relevant laws (see PDP Regime doc to refer and apply) 
- Banking Act 
- Computer Misuse Act 
- Cybersecurity Act 

Cases – 
- My Digital Lock – Discontinued. Dispute between employee and employer, the true nature of the dispute was over the complainant’s alleged online attacks and harassing acts – this was not the province of the PDPA.
- Re Ocean Front – at MCST meeting, complainants were subjects of a complaint that they verbally abused MCST staff. Afterwards, they requested that the meeting minutes with their personal data be removed from the notice board. PDPC discontinued investigations. MCST required to keep meeting minutes under Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA), and in any case, the org had already removed the complainants’ names and unit numbers from the meeting minutes.

What is a voluntary undertaking? When could an organisation give one to PDPC? 
For more info, see Part V of the Enforcement Guidelines 

Basics 
- Source: s 48L PDPA 
- As an alternative to full investigation 
- Allows organizations with demonstrable accountability practices (e.g. IMDA DP Trustmark certified, has effective monitoring and breach management systems etc.) and an effective remediation plan to be given the opportunity to implement their remediation plan in relation to the incident within a specified time 

The possibility of a voluntary undertaking may arise when:
- the organisation is able to demonstrate that it has in place accountable policies and practices;
- the organisation is ready with a remediation plan and is committed to implement it forthwith. The remediation plan should detail:
o the likely cause(s) of the incident; 
o the proposed steps to address the cause(s); and
o target completion date(s) of the proposed steps.

Procedure and process
- Request in writing to PDPC, made very soon after the incident is known (early stages of investigations) 
o Rationale – save the Commission the trouble of committing resources to the investigation 
- Request must be accompanied by remediation plan and state how the requirements for voluntary undertaking (above) are met
- PDPC can work with org to suggest revisions to the remediation plan
- PDPC can then accept the undertaking in writing – this doesn’t constitute a finding of data breach 
- Voluntary undertaking then published by PDPC, redacted where appropriate 
o This publication is distinct from any obligation of the org to publish the undertaking, if such publication is one of the terms of the voluntary undertaking 
- Voluntary undertaking must minimally:
o be signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the organization or another authorised senior management officer;
o describe the incident that the organisation is involved in;
o include a remediation plan that sets out the measures that the organisation will take to voluntarily rectify the cause(s) of the incident within a specified time. Such measures may include steps to reduce recurrence of the incident as well as putting in place monitoring and reporting processes, audits and policy/process reviews; and
o contain the organisation’s acknowledgement to provide related reports of the organisation’s and/or third party to the PDPC if and when requested.

Depending on the circumstances, the voluntary undertaking may include (without limitation):
- An undertaking to take specified action within a specified time (for example, for the organisation to improve its cyber-defences and/or carry out penetration testing on its electronic databases); 
- an undertaking to refrain from taking any action (for example, for the organisation to stop using personal data collected without consent); and/or 
- an undertaking to publicise the voluntary undertaking.

The PDPC is unlikely to accept a voluntary undertaking request in any of, but not limited to, the below scenarios:
- the organisation refutes responsibility for the incident;
- it is a repeat incident entailing similar cause(s) of breach;
- the remediation plan does not explain how compliance with the PDPA may be achieved in relation to the incident; 
- the organisation requests for extended time to produce a remediation plan; or
- the breach is wilful or egregious.

Other
- If org withdraws request for voluntary undertaking option before its acceptance, the PDPC can proceed with full investigation or other enforcement action as it deems fit
- Upon non-compliance with the voluntary undertaking, the PDPC can take action that it think fit in the circumstances to ensure the compliance of the org with the terms of the voluntary undertaking, including enforcement remedies under s 50(3A).
o PDPC can publicize the voluntary undertaking, and can still conduct a full investigation
o Can give directions to comply with the voluntary undertaking pursuant to 48L(4).
- If org fails to comply with directions, PDPC can apply for directions to be registered by District Court under s 30 PDPA 


How are PDPC’s directions enforced (i.e. if an organisation fails or refuses to comply with a direction)? 
Section 48M of the PDPA provides that the Commission may register a direction or written notice under section 48H(2), 48I, 48L(4), 48J(1) or 48K(10) of the PDPA in the District Court. A registered direction or written notice has the same force and effect for the purposes of enforcement as if it is an order obtained in the District Court. Legal proceedings may thus be taken on the registered direction to enforce the direction

*When can an organisation or person apply for reconsideration of a PDPC decision or direction? When can they appeal against a PDPC decision or direction?
After the decision – appeal or reconsideration 

CHECK THE ENFORCEMENT GUIDELINES FOR THIS – IT’S ALL THERE AND EASY TO READ 

Flow – either reconsider or appeal (or both, but reconsideration withdraws any pending appeal) 
- Ask for reconsideration of directions or decisions of the PDPC under s 48N PDPA
- Appeal to the Appeal Panel – s 48Q PDPA
o Can appeal the decision of the Appeal Panel to the HC and then CA – s 48R PDPA

[check section] org refuses to comply with the direction, can ask PRPC to reconsider 
- Must bring new evidence 
- Sometimes organizations succeed in getting the penalty reduced 

Appeal process of PDPA 
- Quite a tedious process 
- Appeal panel has the same power as the District Courts – can appeal afterwards to the HC and CA 
- If you read the provision carefully, only decisions with directions can be appealed. If PDPC issues warning or breach finding without penalty, this decision cannot be appealed. 
o This is Lanx’s reading. Can be challenged by org on appeal to HC etc. 

Differences between reconsideration and appeal 
- Reconsideration is decided by the Commission, appeal is heard by a different appeal panel 
- Reconsideration is a simple written application, appeal is a hearing like the initial commission hearing 

*Part E: Specific topics (under Selected Topics Guidelines)
1. Analytics and research
2. Anonymisation
3. Online activities
4. Cloud services

ANALYTICS AND RESEARCH (CHAPTER 2, PDPC GUIDELINES FOR SELECTED TOPICS) 
How does the PDPA apply to organisations that want to conduct analytics and research activities (ARA)?
* If organisation’s ARA involves CUD of PD, it is required to comply with PDPA
* PDPC encourages organisations to use anonymised data as far as possible for ARA as anonymised data is NOT personal data and thus not governed by PDPA – this would minimise any risk for the organisation of a data breach
* If PD is used, individuals have to be informed of and consent to the purposes for which their PD was CUD by organisations unless any exception applies

Business improvement exception
* PDPA provides several exceptions for organisations to use PD without consent of the individual for ARA provided the organisation can meet the requirements and put in safeguards (Part 5 First Schedule and Part 2 Division 2 Second Schedule PDPA) (the business improvement exception):
a. Improving, enhancing or developing new goods or services,
b. Improving, enhancing or developing new methods or processes for business operations in relation to the organisation’s goods and services,
c. Learning or understanding behaviour and preferences of individuals (including groups of individuals segmented by profile), or
d. Identifying goods or services that may be suitable for individuals (including groups of individuals segmented by profile), or personalising or customising any such goods or services for individuals

* 2 REQUIREMENTS: To rely on the business improvement exception, organisations will need to ensure:
a. Business improvement purpose CANNOT reasonably be achieved without the use of PD in an individually identifiable form, AND
b. Organisation’s use of PD for business improvement purpose is one that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.

Research exception
* PDPA also allows organisations to use personal data without consent for more upstream research that may not be immediately directed at business improvements. Division 3 Part 2 of the Second Schedule PDPA (“research exception”) provides that organisations may use personal data for a research purpose, including historical and statistical research, subject to the following 4 REQUIREMENTS:
a. Research purpose CANNOT reasonably be accomplished unless PD is provided in an individually identifiable form,
b. There is a clear public benefit to using the PD for the research purpose,
c. The results of the research will not be used to make any decision that affects the individual, AND
d. In the event the results of the research are published, the organisation must publish the results in a form that does not identify the individual.

Are organisations allowed to retain PD of individuals for analytics and research?
* Organisations should NOT retain personal data for longer than is necessary unless they have legal or business reasons to do so
* Retention of personal data for analytics and research purposes is a valid business reason, if there is an immediate and demonstrable intent to perform analysis or conduct research. 
* Organisations may demonstrate their intention through relevant programmes or departmental functions. Organisations should establish policies and practices when retaining personal data for analytics and research, such as the retention period and considering ways to anonymise the personal data – link to Retention Limitation Obligation under PDPA

ANONYMISATION (CHAPTER 3, PDPC GUIDELINES FOR SELECTED TOPICS) 
Anonymisation is the process of converting PD into data that cannot identify any particular individual, and depending on the process used can be reversible or irreversible – reversibility of the specific process used would be a relevant consideration for organisations when managing the risk of re-identification

PDPC views ‘de-identification’ as referring to only the removal of direct identifiers and does not equate it with ‘anonymisation’. A de-identified dataset may be easily re-identified when combined with data that may be publicly or easily accessible.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA – data record typically comprises different data attributes with varying degrees of identifiability and sensitivity levels to an individual:
a) Direct identifier: this refers to a data attribute that is unique to an individual (e.g. full name, NRIC number or mobile number and can be used as a key data attribute to re-identify an individual in a dataset). This data attribute is typically publicly or easily accessible. --> by convention, treated as PD
b) Indirect identifier: this refers to a data attribute that is not unique to an individual but may re-identify an individual when combined with other information (e.g. age, gender, nationality, blood group, education, name of company and postal code). This data attribute is typically publicly or easily accessible.
c) Target attributes: in the context of assessing adequacy of anonymisation, this refers to a data attribute that may be sensitive in nature and may result in a high potential adverse effect to an individual when disclosed. This data attribute is usually not publicly or easily accessible (e.g. health or credit information).

* Anonymisation involves a set of risk management controls. Data would NOT be considered anonymised if there is a serious possibility that an individual could be re-identified, taking into consideration:
a. The data itself, or the data combined with other information to which the recipient organisation has or is likely to have access to, and
b. Measures and safeguards (or lack thereof) implemented by the organisation to mitigate the risk of re-identification

Data that has been anonymised is no longer considered personal data for the purposes of the PDPA. As the effectiveness of anonymisation may degrade over time, periodic reviews should be conducted to be assured that the data remains anonymised and measures that deal with re-identification risks remain adequate.

Considerations for anonymising data
a) Nature and type of data (e.g. some data types are inherently rich and full of information like portrait photographs taken for facial recognition purposes – any alteration of which may render it useless for its intended purposes) 
b) Potential impact on individuals – consider any potential negative impact on individuals if they were re-identified, especially highly sensitive information like HIV records, records of adopted children
c) Nature of use and extent of disclosure – where an organisation intends to use the anonymised data within the organisation itself, or where the organisation intends to disclose anonymised data only to a restricted group (or groups) of users (e.g. a closed community of researchers), re-identification risks can be managed better, compared to the situation where the organisation discloses the anonymised data to any user publicly.
d) Public knowledge and personal knowledge – e.g. risk of re-identification in a disclosure of data to a single entity for research and development of new products and services under a non-disclosure agreement vs publishing data to the world at large
e) Data recipient’s ability and motivation to re-identify
f) Changing environment – dataset may be anonymised at a particular point in time, but not guaranteed it will stay anonymised permanently
g) Archiving anonymised data – where an organisation anonymises data for the purposes of archival post-retention period, information that allows it to re-identify the individuals should not be kept
h) Transferring anonymised datasets – especially if anonymised data is transferred out of Singapore (check the data protection obligations in the destination country)

Re-identification
Re-identification refers to the identification of individuals from a dataset that was previously de-identified or anonymised. It can occur as a result of combining separate datasets. When determining whether a dataset is anonymised, the organisation should consider whether there is a serious possibility that an individual can be identified from the dataset when it is combined with other information that the data recipient has or is likely to have access to, by carrying out an assessment of the risk of re-identification. 

In general, factors affecting the risk of re-identification include: 
a) the amount of alteration the data has been subjected to in the course of anonymisation, 
b) the extent of disclosure, 
c) the availability of other relevant information, and 
d) the recipients’ ability and motivation to re-identify the data.

For the data to be considered anonymised, the following criteria should be met:
a) All direct identifiers should be removed

b) All indirect identifiers that can be used to re-identify individuals when matched with publicly available or proprietary information that the organisation knows the data recipient has access to should be altered or removed to prevent re-identification from the data.

c) Additional safeguards may be implemented by the data recipient to restrict access and use of the anonymised data to reduce the risks of disclosure and thus risks of re-identification, depending on the extent of anonymisation performed and assessed re-identification risks, such as –
(i) limiting the number of data recipients to whom the information is disclosed and the number of persons that can access the information;
(ii) imposing restrictions on the data recipient(s) on the use and subsequent disclosure of the data;
(iii) requiring the data recipient(s) to implement processes to govern the proper use and disclosure of the anonymised data in line with the imposed restrictions; and/or
(iv) requiring the data recipient(s) to implement processes and measures for the destruction of data as soon as the data no longer serves any business or legal purpose.

d) Stringent internal safeguards should be implemented on the set of information (e.g. identity mapping tables or other datasets containing linkable information) that can be used to re-identify individuals from the anonymised data, such as –
(i) organisational structures;
(ii) policies, administrative rules or processes;
(iii) technical measures (e.g. using encryption to restrict access to the information, limiting access to only authorised users, and controlling access through passwords); and/or
(iv) physical measures (e.g. restricted access to information storage areas).

e) Periodic reviews should be conducted, particularly where anonymised data is disclosed over a period of time in an ongoing relationship, to ensure that the risk of re-identification from the anonymised data is minimised and acceptable. The review should assess – 
(i) The adequacy of anonymisation techniques and risk management controls in relation to the current stage of technology, and
(ii) the robustness of organisational, legal, processes and other non-technical measures to manage the risks of re-identification, considering technological developments over time.

Assessing risks of re-identification
Organisations should understand that anonymisation is a risk-based process, which includes applying both anonymisation techniques and safeguards to prevent re-identification. In anonymising data, organisations should assess the sensitivity and potential harms of the target attributes should they be disclosed and/or re-identified. If the nature of data is highly sensitive to individuals, the organisation should reduce the granularity of such data to reduce any potential harms arising from disclosure or re-identification.

Where possible, organisations should practise data minimisation and share only the minimally necessary anonymised data attributes and an extract from, instead of their full, database. As a good practice, organisations should also conduct a “motivated intruder” test to assess any residual risks of re-identification of the anonymised data.
* The ‘motivated intruder’ test considers whether individuals can be re-identified from anonymised data by someone who is motivated, reasonably competent, has access to standard resources (e.g. the Internet and published information such as public directories), and employs standard investigative techniques (e.g. making enquiries of people who may have additional knowledge of the identity of the data subject).

It is not necessary that the most technically sophisticated anonymisation technology be used all the time. Rather, what is required is one that is sufficiently robust to manage the risk of re-identification, given the circumstances (e.g. the extent of disclosure, the intended recipient(s) and existing controls). Organisations may also consider hiring anonymisation experts, statisticians, or independent risk assessors to aid in their assessment of the appropriate anonymisation techniques to apply or assessment of re-identification risks, particularly where the anonymisation issues are complex (e.g. large datasets containing longitudinal or a wide range of personal data).

When can anonymised data be disclosed publicly?
Where the anonymised data is aggregated to the extent that the anonymisation is irreversible and there is no serious possibility of re-identification of individuals, the anonymised data may be publicly disclosed (e.g. open data). Organisations should take care when doing so as the open data cannot be recovered. The effectiveness of technical and process safeguards will be limited but organisations should consider appropriate legal safeguards (e.g. prohibit unauthorised intentional re-identification, unless for research purposes).

ONLINE ACTIVITIES (CHAPTER 7, PDPC GUIDELINES FOR SELECTED TOPICS) 
A multitude of data is generated and captured during our online activities (including our use of mobile and other lifestyle devices (e.g. activity trackers and smart watches)). Some identifiers are provided by the user (e.g. email address or mobile number) or assigned by the organisation (e.g. customer IDs); other identifiers are programmatically generated and assigned: e.g. hash generated from email address, device fingerprints, IP addresses and cookies.

Organisations may collect other types of data from and about its customers. For example, payment particulars and billing and delivery information provided by customers during check out; and also, behavioural data generated by the customers’ use of the service, such as browsing and search activities. Such data, when linked to an identifier, will form part of the personal data that the organisation is collecting about individuals. For example, an IP address or tracking cookie may be matched with other data elements such as browsing history, purchase history, postal code, mobile numbers and shopping preferences such that the organisation may be able to identify an individual.

IP addresses
An IP address, or any other network identifier such as an IMEI number, may NOT be personal data when viewed in isolation, because it simply identifies a networked device. However, IP addresses have the potential of identifying unique individuals through their activities.
* If each individual has separate login accounts, then the online activities that are related to that login identity, along with other information such as cookies (addressed below) and IP addresses can identify individuals, and are likely to be personal data in such context.
* IP tracking may NOT result in the collection of personal data, if the organisation is unable to identify an individual from the data collected or from that data and other information that the organisation has or is likely to have access.
* However, organisations should note that the more data points associated to a unique IP address an organisation collects, the more likely that an individual may be identifiable from the data and thus may constitute as personal data. For example, if an organisation profiles the websites visited by an IP address, the items purchased by the same IP address and other online activities and data associated to the IP address for a long period of time, and is able to ascertain that the particular IP address is associated with an identifiable person, the organisation may be found to have collected personal data.

Cookies
Cookies are text files created on a client computer when its web browser loads a website or web application.

Many Internet activities today are dependent on the use of cookies, such that unnecessarily restricting the use of cookies will impede the usability of the Internet. However, because cookies can be used to collect personal data, organisations should be mindful of the concern surrounding the use of cookies for individuals’ online activities. It is thus important to strike a balanced approach on the need for consent in the use of cookies.

Not all cookies collect PD – e.g. session cookies may only collect and store technical data needed to play back a video on a website. Consent is NOT needed for cookies that do not collect personal data

For internet activities that the user has clearly requested, NO need to seek consent for the use of cookies to CUD PD where the individual is aware of the purposes of such CUD and voluntarily provided his PD for such purposes, e.g. transmitting PD for effecting online communications and storing information that the user enters in a web form to facilitate an online purchase, and reasonable activities that cannot take place without cookies that CUD PD like authentication and security, user preference, network management or streaming content.

Consent may also be reflected in the way a user configures his interaction with the Internet. If the individual configures his browser to accept certain cookies but rejects others, he may be found to have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of his personal data by the cookies that he has chosen to accept.

The obligation to obtain the individual’s consent for the collection of his personal data rests with the organisation that is collecting such personal data, whether by itself or through its data intermediaries. Where an organisation operates a website which a third party uses to collect personal data, and the website operator itself is not collecting such personal data, the obligation is on the third party organisation to obtain the consent required to collect such personal data.

Obligation to obtain the individual’s consent for the collection of his personal data rests with the organisation that is collecting such personal data, whether by itself or through its data intermediaries. Where an organisation operates a website which a third party uses to collect personal data, and the website operator itself is not collecting such personal data, the obligation is on the third party organisation to obtain the consent required to collect such personal data.

Where targeting of advertisements involves the collection and use of personal data through cookies, the individual’s consent is required. Consent may be reflected through his browser settings. As good practice, organisations should provide individuals with the ability to set their cookie preferences within the website to enable or disable the use of such cookies for personalised advertisement targeting.

CLOUD SERVICES (CHAPTER 9, PDPC GUIDELINES FOR SELECTED TOPICS) 
When using cloud services, the organisation is responsible for complying with all obligations under the PDPA in respect of personal data processed by the cloud service provider (“CSP”) on its behalf and for its purposes. Processing is defined in the PDPA as the carrying out of any operation or set of operations in relation to the personal data, and includes recording, holding, organising, adapting or altering, and retrieval of personal data.

Where the CSP is processing personal data on behalf and for the purposes of another organisation pursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in writing, the CSP is considered a data intermediary and subject to the Protection, Retention Limitation and Data Breach Notification Obligations under the PDPA. Its Protection, Retention Limitation and Data Breach Notification Obligations extend to personal data that it processes or hosts for the organisation in data centres outside Singapore. The CSP, as an organisation in its own right, remains responsible for complying with all Data Protection Provisions in respect of its own activities which do not constitute processing of personal data under the contract.

An organisation that engages a CSP as a data intermediary to provide cloud services is responsible for complying with the Transfer Limitation Obligation in respect of any overseas transfer of personal data in using the CSP’s cloud services. This is regardless of whether the CSP is located in Singapore or overseas.
* An organisation should ensure that any overseas transfer of personal data as a result of engaging a CSP will be done in accordance with the requirements under the PDPA, namely, the organisation could ensure that the CSP it uses only transfers data to locations with comparable data protection regimes, or has legally enforceable obligations to ensure a comparable standard of protection for the transferred PD
* Such issues of compliance can be provided for in the written contract between an organisation and its CSP. The contract should deal with both the standard of protection and the overseas locations
* The organisation may be considered to have taken appropriate measures to comply with the Transfer Limitation Obligation by ensuring that personal data may only be transferred to overseas locations with comparable data protection laws, or that the recipients (e.g. data centres or sub-processors) in these locations are legally bound by similar contractual standards

* CSPs based in Singapore have to meet the standards of protection under the Data Protection Provisions when they process personal data as data intermediaries
* Where the contract between an organisation and its CSP does not specify the locations to which a CSP may transfer the personal data processed and leaves it to the discretion of the CSP, the organisation may be considered to have taken appropriate steps to comply with the Transfer Limitation Obligation by ensuring that:
(a) the CSP based in Singapore is certified or accredited as meeting relevant industry standards, and 
(b) the CSP provides assurances that all the data centres or sub-processors in overseas locations that the personal data is transferred to comply with these standards. 

For example, the organisation could consider engaging a CSP that is certified as compliant with the ISO27001 standard and can produce technical audit reports such as the SOC-2 upon request.


Regulation of Cybersecurity under PDPA and Cybersecurity Act 

*Cybersecurity

- Failure to comply is an offence (s 8(4) CYSA) 
- Same exception for legal privilege as s 19 

The Commissioner may designate a computer or computer system as CII if these 2 REQUIREMENTS apply (s 7(1) CYSA): 
- the computer or computer system is necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service (see definition of essential services above), and the loss or compromise of the computer or computer system will have a debilitating effect on the availability of the essential service in Singapore 
- the computer or computer system is located wholly or partially in Singapore (Q: what about cloud-based services?)

A designation under s 7(1) CYSA: 
- Must inter alia inform the CII’s owner of the owner’s duties and responsibilities under the CYSA that arise from the designation (s 7(3) CYSA) 
- Is valid for 5 years (s 7(3) CYSA) 

Obligation on owners: Obtaining information relating to a CII (s 10, 12, 13 CYSA) 
Summary: 
- Commissioner may require owner of CII to furnish information about it 
- CII owner must update Commissioner about changes to CII 
- CII owner must update Commissioner about changes in ownership

Same exception for legal privilege, etc. as s 19

Codes of Practice and Standards of Performance (s 11 CYSA) 
Summary 
- The CYSA permits the Commissioner to issue codes of practice or standards of performance for CIIs.
- One such code of practice has been issued, in 2022 
- The Codes of Practice and Standards cover cybersecurity requirements GENERALLY and is not sector-specific

The Commissioner may issue or approve one or more codes of practice or standards of performance for the regulation of the owners of CII with respect to measures to be taken by them to ensure the cybersecurity of the CII (s 11(1)(a))

Every owner of a CII must *comply with the codes of practice and standards of performance that apply to their CII (following publication of a notice relating to the code or standard) unless otherwise waived by the Commissioner under s 11(7) (s 11(6) CYSA) 

The Commissioner may amend or revoke any code of practice or standard of performance (s 11(1)(b)))

The Commissioner must publish a notice of the issuance, approval, amendment or revocation of a code of practice or standard of performance (s 11(3)) failing which it does not take effect (s 11(4))

A code of practice or standard of performance does not have legislative effect (s 11(5)) and any of its provisions that is inconsistent with the CYSA does not have effect (to the extent of the inconsistency) (s 11(2)) 

The Commissioner for Cybersecurity / CSA issued the Cybersecurity Code of Practice for Critical Information Infrastructure on 4 July 2022, last updated 12 Dec 2022 (https://www.csa.gov.sg/legislation/codes-of-practice)

Directions to ensure cybersecurity of a CII (s 12 CYSA) 
The Commissioner may issue a direction to the owner(s) of a CII in order to:
- ensure the cybersecurity of the CII or 
- it is necessary or expedient for the administration of the CYSA (s 12(1) CYSA) 

Without limitation, a direction may include the following (s 12(2) CYSA): 
- the action to be taken by the owner(s) in relation to a cybersecurity threat 
- compliance with any code of practice or standard of performance applicable to the owner(s) 
- appointment of an auditor approved by the Commissioner to audit the owner(s) on their compliance with the CYSA or any code of practice or standard of performance applicable to the owner(s) 
--> one difference from PDPA (PDPC cannot compel an audit)

Process for issuance of a direction includes giving the owner an opportunity to make representations (s 12(4) & (5)) 

Failure to comply is an offence (s 12(6))

Duty to report cybersecurity incident in respect of CIIs (s 14 CYSA) 
The owner of a CII must notify the Commissioner upon the occurrence of any of the following (s 14(1) CYSA): 
- a prescribed cybersecurity incident in respect of the CII or any other computer or computer system under the CII owner’s control that is interconnected with or that communicates with the CII 
- any other type of cybersecurity incident in respect of the CII that the Commissioner has specified by written direction to the owner

The owner of a CII must establish such mechanisms and processes for the purposes of detecting cybersecurity threats and incidents in respect of the CII, as set out in any applicable code of practice (s 14(2))

Failure to comply is an offence (s 14(3))

Cybersecurity Audits and Risk Assessments (s 15 CYSA) --> cf PDPA which does not have requirements to audit
The owner of a CII must comply with the following (s 15(1)): 
- at least once every 2 years, cause an audit to be carried out of the compliance of the CII with the CYSA and the applicable codes of practice and standards of performance (to be done by an auditor approved or appointed by the Commissioner) 
- at least once a year, conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment of the CII 

The owner of a CII must furnish a copy of the audit report or risk assessment to the Commissioner within 30 days of completion (s 15(2)) 

See the rest of the section for further details (brief summary here, not sure if needed) 
- Commissioner can require CII owner to redo audit if not satisfactory – 15(3) 
- Commissioner can order an audit (over and above the usual requirements) where it looks like the owner of CII has not complied with standards or has provided incorrect information – 15(4) 
- Commissioner can order CII owner to take additional steps for cybersecurity risk assessment – 15(5) 
- Where CII undergoes material changes, Commissioner can order CII owner to carry out another audit or cybersecurity risk assessment – 15(6) 

Failure to comply is an offence (s 15(7) & (8))

Cybersecurity exercises (s 16 CYSA)
The Commissioner may conduct cybersecurity exercises for the purpose of testing the state of readiness of owners of different CII in responding to significant cybersecurity incidents. 

An owner of a CII must participate in a cybersecurity exercise if directed in writing to do so by the Commissioner

Failure to comply is an offence (s 15(7) & (8))

*RESPONSE TO CYBERSECURITY THREATS AND INCIDENTS --> PART 4 CYSA APPLIES GENERALLY, INCLUDING CIIS AND NON-CIIS (ANY ORGANISATION)
Investigation (s 19 CYSA) 
The Commissioner may investigate any cybersecurity threat or incident for the following purposes (s 19(1) CYSA):
- assessing the impact or potential impact of the cybersecurity threat or incident 
- preventing harm arising from the cybersecurity incident 
- preventing a further cybersecurity incident from arising from that cybersecurity threat or incident

The Commissioner’s powers of investigation (s 19(2)) may be applied as against any person (e.g. to compel attendance and obtain information) and failure to comply is an offence (s 19(8)) 

Legal Privilege, etc.: Disclosure of information that is subject to any right, privilege or immunity conferred, or obligation or limitation imposed, by or under any law or rules of professional conduct in relation to the disclosure of such information is NOT required, except that the performance of a contractual obligation is not an excuse for not disclosing the information (s 19(6) CYSA) 
- TLDR – other laws and kinds of privilege override the requirement to disclose. 
- But contractual obligations (NDAs or confidentiality agreements) don’t override the requirement to disclose, so must still disclose even with such NDAs or confidentiality agreements

Elimination of Serious Threats and Incidents (s 20 CYSA) 
The Commissioner has additional powers in relation to any cybersecurity threat or incident that meets any of the following criteria (s 20(3) CYSA):
- it creates a risk of significant harm being caused to a CII (CII-related)
- it creates a risk of disruption to the provision of an essential service (CII-related)
- it creates a threat to the national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety or public order of Singapore (CII-related)
- it is of a severe nature, in terms of the severity of the harm that may be caused to persons in Singapore or the number of computers or value of the information put at risk, whether or not the computers or computer systems put at risk are themselves CII --> applies even if non-CIIs are related

The Commissioner may investigate any such serious cybersecurity threat or incident for the following purposes (s 20(1) CYSA): 
- assessing the impact or potential impact of the cybersecurity threat or incident 
- eliminating the threat or preventing harm arising from the cybersecurity incident 
- preventing a further cybersecurity incident

For such serious cybersecurity threats and incidents, the Commissioner may (s 20(2) CYSA):
- exercise its powers under s 19(2)(a), (b), (c) or (d)
- direct, (by written notice) any person to carry out remedial measures, or to cease carrying on certain activities in relation to a computer or computer system that [...] is or was affected by the cybersecurity incident, in order to minimize cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the computer or computer system 
- require the owner of a computer or computer system to take any action to assist with the investigation (examples in the Act) 
- enter premises, perform scans, obtain records, etc.

Examples of remedial measures (under s 20(2) CYSA) include the following: 
- removal of malicious software from the computer; 
- installation of software updates to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities; 
- temporarily disconnecting infected computers from a computer network until the above is carried out 
- redirection of malicious data traffic towards a designated computer or computer system

**Part G: Cybersecurity and PDPA 
PDPA imposes cybersecurity-related obligations in relation to personal data in two areas: 
- The Protection Obligation relating to personal data under an organization’s control 
- Data breach notifications 

PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA (S 24 PDPA) --> APPLIES TO DATA INTERMEDIARIES ALSO!
Under the PDPA, all organisations are required to protect personal data by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent the following (s 24 PDPA): 
- unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks 
- loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored

In a modern context, as most data is stored in electronic form in computers, computer systems and other electronic / digital devices and systems, this translates to requirements to ensure cybersecurity of systems and databases containing personal data

Requirements:
- Covers personal data in the possession or under the control of the organization 
--> control: where there is data intermediary or data is stored with a 3P service provider, there is still CONTROL over that data
- “reasonable security arrangements” – not defined (Side note: This kind of wording is found in many other countries law including, e.g. EU and US) 
- Two key elements, measures are to prevent:
o unauthorised access, etc. to personal data
o loss of storage media / devices containing personal data

*PDPC’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA 
“There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for organisations to comply with the Protection Obligation. Each organisation should consider adopting security arrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances ...” (Para 17 PDPC’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in PDPA)

Factors to take into consideration: 
- Nature of the personal data --> how sensitive is the data? More sensitive, the more measures should be in place
- Form in which the personal data was collected (e.g. electronic or physical) 
- Possible impact to the individual concerned if an unauthorised person obtains, modifies or disposes of the personal data

In practice, an organisation should: 
- Design and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal data held by the organisation and the possible harm that may result from a security breach 
- Identify reliable and well-trained personnel responsible for ensuring information security 
- Implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of security for personal data of varying levels of sensitivity 
- Be prepared and able to respond to information security breaches promptly and effectively 

Security arrangements include: 
- Administrative measures (e.g. confidentiality obligations (in NDA, confidentiality agreements), robust policies, staff training) 
- Technical measures (e.g. network security measures, access control, use of encryption) 
- Physical measures (e.g. physical locks, privacy filters, proper disposal of physical documents)

In relation to data intermediaries and the organisations that engage them (data controllers), note that s 24 PDPA applies to both (per s 4(2) & (3) PDPA)
- *Scope of responsibility depends on extent of tasks to be done by each: 
o Processing by the data intermediary (implement necessary technical, physical and administrative measures)
o Governance by the data controller (implement, typically via contract, measures to govern the data intermediary’s protection of personal data) --> more from governance perspective via contract, selection of data intermediary

**DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION (S 26A AND 26B PDPA) --> THREATS HAVE MATERIALISED
Data breach: 
(a) Unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal of personal data, or
(b) Loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored in circumstances where the unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal of the personal data is likely to occur

In circumstances where the unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal of the personal data is LIKELY to occur (cf s 24 which is more preventative, in s 26A these threats have materialised)

NB: NOT EVERY DATA BREACH IS REPORTABLE / NOTIFIABLE!

**Threshold for notification
Notifiable data breach: a data breach that –
(a) Results in, or is likely to result in, SIGNIFICANT HARM to an affect individual, OR
(b) Is, or is likely to be, of a SIGNIFICANT SCALE
--> EITHER SIGNIFICANT HARM OR SIGNFICIANT SCALE, AS LONG AS ONE IS FULFILLED THEN REPORTABLE TO PDPC/INDIVIDUAL

* A data breach is deemed to result in significant harm and of significant scale in prescribed circumstances (s 26B(2)-(3) PDPA):
o *Significant harm: if the data breach is in relation to any prescribed personal data or class of personal data relating to the individual; or in other prescribed circumstances (Reg 3 and Schedule DBN Regulations):
* SITUATION 1: Individual’s full name, alias or identification number, AND any personal data or classes of personal data relating to:
1. The amount of any wages, salary, fee, commission, bonus, gratuity, allowance or other remuneration paid or payable to the individual by any person, whether under a contract of service or a contract for services.
2. The income of the individual from the sale of any goods or property.
3. The number of any credit card, charge card or debit card issued to or in the name of the individual.
4. The number assigned to any account the individual has with any organisation that is a bank or finance company.
5. Any information that identifies, or is likely to lead to the identification of, the individual as a child or young person who has been subject to investigation under CYPA, arrested, taken into care and custody by social welfare…
OR
* SITUATION 2: ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS/DETAILS – The following personal data relating to an individual’s account with an organisation: (i) account identifier, like account name or number, (ii) any password, security code, access code, response to a security question, biometric data or other data used or required to allow access to the account

o *Significant scale: if the data breach affects not fewer than 500 individuals (Reg 4 DBN Regulations)

* NB: data breach that relates to the unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying or modification of personal data only within an organisation is deemed NOT to be a notifiable data breach (s 26B(4) PDPA)

**DBN Obligations
Step 1: Conduct an assessment of a Data Breach (to see severity and whether it is notifiable)
Where an organisation has reason to believe that a data breach has occurred affecting PD in its possession or under its control:
* If organisation is a DATA INTERMEDIARY and the affected data is data it is processing for the data controller, the DI MUST notify the data controller of the data breach WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY (s 26C(3) PDPA) 
--> WITHIN 24 HOURS IS A GUIDELINE
NB: no need for data intermediary to report to PDPC, that is only for the data controller (if notifiable)!

* If organisation is a DATA CONTROLLER, it must conduct, in a reasonable and expeditious manner, an assessment of whether the data breach is a notifiable data breach (s 26C(2) PDPA)
--> UP TO 30 DAYS IS A GUIDELINE

* Also note obligation of a data intermediary of a public agency (s 26E PDPA)

Step 2: Notification to PDPC (if it is a notifiable data breach) --> NB: might also have to report to CSA if CII affected under CYSA, etc.
Where an organisation assess that a data breach is notifiable, it must notify PDPC as soon as practicable and, in any case, within 3 calendar days (s 26D(1) PDPA)
* Notification must be made via PDPC website 
* Notification must contain the prescribed information, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the organisation when the notification is made (s 26D(3) PDPA). Specific information required is set out in DBN Regulations (Reg 5 DBN Regulations) and the relevant webform of the PDPC website:
a. the date on which and the circumstances in which the organisation first became aware that the data breach had occurred;
b. a chronological account of the steps taken by the organisation after the organisation became aware that the data breach had occurred, including the organisation’s assessment under section 26C(2) or (3)(b) of the Act that the data breach is a notifiable data breach;
c. information on how the notifiable data breach occurred;
d. the number of affected individuals affected by the notifiable data breach;

f. the potential harm to the affected individuals as a result of the notifiable data breach;
g. information on any action by the organisation, whether taken before or to be taken after the organisation notifies the Commission of the occurrence of the notifiable data breach —
(i) to eliminate or mitigate any potential harm to any affected individual as a result of the notifiable data breach; and
(ii) to address or remedy any failure or shortcoming that the organisation believes to have caused, or enabled or facilitated the occurrence of, the notifiable data breach;

* Notification to PDPC (and affected individuals) apply concurrently with any other obligations of the organisation to notify any other person (e.g. Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore) of the occurrence of a data breach

Step 3: Notification to affected individuals
Where an organisation assess that a data breach is notifiable and it results, or is likely to result, in significant harm to the affected individuals, it must also notify the affected individuals ON OR AFTER NOTIFYING PDPC (s 26D(2) PDPA)
* Notification to the affected individuals is to be made in any manner that is reasonable in the circumstances (s 26D(2) PDPA)
* Notification must contain the prescribed information in Reg 6 DBN Regulations, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the organisation when the notification is made (s 26D(3) PDPA):
a. the circumstances in which the organisation first became aware that the notifiable data breach had occurred;
b. the personal data or classes of personal data relating to the affected individual affected by the notifiable data breach;
c. the potential harm to the affected individual as a result of the notifiable data breach;
d. information on any action by the organisation, whether taken before or to be taken after the organisation notifies the affected individual —
(i) to eliminate or mitigate any potential harm to the affected individual as a result of the notifiable data breach; and
(ii) to address or remedy any failure or shortcoming that the organisation believes to have caused, or enabled or facilitated the occurrence of, the notifiable data breach;
e. the steps that the affected individual may take to eliminate or mitigate any potential harm as a result of the notifiable data breach, including preventing the misuse of the affected individual’s personal data affected by the notifiable data breach;
f. the business contact information of at least one authorised representative of the organisation.

Exceptions to this requirement: --> i.e. no need to inform affected individuals in these cases
* If the organisation, on or after assessing that the data breach is a notifiable data breach, takes any action, in accordance with any prescribed requirements, that renders it unlikely that the notifiable data breach will result in significant harm to the affected individual (s 26D(5)(a) PDPA)

* If the organisation had implemented, prior to the occurrence of the notifiable data breach, any technological measure that renders it unlikely that the notifiable data breach will result in significant harm to the affected individual (s 26D(5)(b) PDPA)

* If a prescribed law enforcement agency so instructs or PDPC so directs (s 26D(6) PDPA) --> e.g. under police investigation

* PDPC, on application by the organisation, waives the requirement (s 26D(7) PDPA)

Relevant case – The Singhealth data breach 
Thanks https://www.technologylawdispatch.com/2019/01/privacy-data-protection/worst-breach-of-personal-data-in-singapores-history-attracts-highest-penalties-totalling-s1-million/ for the helpful case summary! Emphasis in the text is mine 
- Note – facts of the case wont’ be tested. Good for context (how the criminals managed to get into the system) 
- The criminals got in through a minor, unimportant computer system that was connected to the internet, then spent months exploring the network for credentials and weaknesses until they found credentials for a server containing patient data 

On 14 January 2019, Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Commission issued its grounds of decision against Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd. (SingHealth) and Integrated Health Information Systems Pte. Ltd. (IHiS) for what has been coined the “worst breach of personal data in Singapore’s history”.
The unprecedented cyber attack on SingHealth’s patient database system led to the exfiltration of 1.5 million patients’ personal data and nearly 160,000 patients’ outpatient prescription records.
The commission received several complaints from members of the public regarding this data breach and commenced its investigations thereafter.

The facts of this case were as follows:
* SingHealth is one of three healthcare clusters in the Singapore public healthcare sector. IHiS is the central national information technology (IT) agency for the public healthcare sector in Singapore.
* SingHealth uses Sunrise Clinical Manager system (SCM), an electronic medical record software solution managed by IHiS, which is actively used by SingHealth staff in patient care and management. The SCM contains the patient medical records of over five million unique individuals, including the following types of personal data:
(a) patient particulars (name, national registration identification card numbers, address, gender, race and date of birth);
(b) clinical episode information (e.g., accident and emergency, impatient and outpatient data);
(c) laboratory, radiology, cardiology, medication and nursing orders;
(d) results of diagnostic tests and orders; 
(e) clinical documentation from doctors, nurses and/or rehabilitation; 
(f) vital signs, e.g., blood pressure, pulse; 
(g) medical alerts and allergies;
(h) diagnosis and health issues;
(i) vaccination details;
(j) discharge summaries;
(k) medical certificates; and
(l) outpatient medication dispensed (with associated patient demographics).
* The cyber attacker gained initial access to the SCM network in August 2017 by infecting a user’s workstation, likely through an email phishing attack that led to malware and hacking tools being installed and executed on the workstation.
* Through customized malware that infected and gained remote access to and control of other workstations between December 2017 and May 2018, the attacker gained access to a local administrator account and another service account. The attacker was then able to access and control the Citrix servers located at one of the public healthcare institutions. However, the attacker still did not have the credentials that would have enabled it to log in to the SCM database. As such, the attacker made multiple failed attempts to access it using invalid credentials. On 26 June 2018, the attacker managed to successfully obtain login credentials for the SCM database, which were then used to access the SCM database using one of the compromised Citrix servers.
* The security incident response manager for IHiS was notified of the suspicious circumstances observed by IHiS staff. SingHealth’s chief information security officer was also apprised of the events but did not make further enquiries. Neither personnel escalated the matter. As such, IHiS senior management and SingHealth’s group chief information officer were only alerted to the attack on the evening of 9 July 2018.

The commission’s findings were as follows:
* Based on several policy documents including its data protection policy, IHiS is a data intermediary for SingHealth and all other healthcare institutions in the three clusters. Pursuant to section 4(3) of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), an organisation that engages a data intermediary to process personal data on its behalf and for its purposes has the same obligation in respect of such data as if it had processed the data itself. Hence, both SingHealth and IHiS have an obligation to make reasonable security arrangements to protect patients’ personal data in their possession or control, in accordance with section 24 of the PDPA.
* The commission reiterated that although organisations may outsource work to vendors, the responsibility for complying with statutory obligations under the PDPA may not be delegated. In other words, SingHealth had “the primary role and responsibility of ensuring the overall protection of the personal data in its possession or under its control, even if it has engaged a data intermediary that has a duty to protect the personal data”.
* The commission stressed the importance of having a contract that sets out the obligations and responsibilities of a data intermediary to protect the organisation’s personal data and the parties’ respective roles, obligations and responsibilities to protect the personal data. This need for a contract was also highlighted in other jurisdictions, namely, in an information leaflet on the outsourcing of processing of personal data to data processors published by Hong Kong’s privacy commission, as well as a guidance note on privacy and outsourcing for businesses by Canada’s privacy commission.
* In assessing whether each of SingHealth and IHiS had complied with their obligations under section 24 of the PDPA by making reasonable security arrangements, the commission considered the following factors as set out in its advisory guidelines on key concepts in the PDPA (revised on 27 July 2017):
(a) the nature of the personal data;
(b) the form in which the personal data had been collected (physical or electronic); and
(c) the possible impact to the individuals concerned if an unauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the personal data.
* The commission determined that the SCM database contains the full medical records of all SingHealth patients, which is “very sensitive personal information”. Citing its advisory guidelines for the healthcare sector (updated on 28 March 2017), the commission noted that the data is “regarded as more confidential” and “the adverse impact to individuals is significantly greater if such personal data were inadvertently accessed (e.g. relating to sensitive medical conditions)”, and hence “tighter security arrangements should be employed” and it was “critical to protect the security and confidentiality of such medical records”.
* SingHealth’s chief information security officer had failed to comply with the various incident response policies and standard operating procedures of the organisation. More specifically, even though he was informed of suspicious activities showing multiple failed log in attempts of the SCM, he did not escalate these security events, and this “fell far short of what a reasonable person would expect from someone in his position”. The actions of SingHealth’s group chief information officer and chief information security officer, and in particular, the failure to comply with standard operating procedures, was emblematic of the inadequacy of SingHealth’s security arrangements and should be attributed to SingHealth itself.
* In addition, although SingHealth had maintained oversight of IHiS’s IT operations and security for the SCM through oversight and auditing mechanisms, and board and management committees, it had not taken sufficient security measures to protect the personal data in the SCM database.
* In respect of IHiS, by its own admission, there were a number of vulnerabilities and gaps in SingHealth’s network and in the IHiS systems and processes that were exploited by the attacker. In addition, the commission noted that IHiS regularly handles large volumes of sensitive personal data on behalf of public healthcare institutions in Singapore. Hence its policies and practices, and how they were implemented and enforced, were insufficient, particularly in the management of the Citrix servers.
* Further, there were insufficient steps taken to ensure that technical measures to protect personal data were carried out as intended, and vulnerabilities that had been previously flagged to IHiS were either not remediated or not addressed in time.
* The PDPA does not require organisations to provide an absolute guarantee for the protection of the personal data in its possession or under its control, but even so, IHiS was found not to have done what a reasonable person would consider appropriate to prevent the data breach in this case.
* The commission found that both SingHealth and IHiS had breached section 24 of the PDPA and directed SingHealth to pay a financial penalty of S$250,000 and IHiS a financial penalty of S$750,000.
