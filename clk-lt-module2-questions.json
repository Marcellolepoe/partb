      "question": "According to the automobile case study, what was the 'law of the metal horse' and how did it develop?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The 'law of the metal horse' was a specialized legal framework created immediately when cars were invented, with no connection to horse carriage rules.",
        "B": "The mass adoption of cars in the early 1900s increased accidents, so the law had to respond; courts applied the word 'driver' (previously for horse carriage drivers) to cars, mainly using negligence rules premised on driver's control of vehicle; horse carriage rules readily applied because they were analogous.",
        "C": "The 'law of the metal horse' refers only to traffic laws and has no connection to liability or insurance frameworks.",
        "D": "The 'law of the metal horse' was created by automobile manufacturers to avoid liability, with no input from courts or legislatures."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "According to the automobile case study, the 'law of the metal horse' refers to the entire framework of law and systems surrounding the automobile that developed as cars replaced horses. The mass adoption of cars in the early 1900s increased the number of accidents, so the law had to respond once the risk was new. Courts applied the word 'driver' (previously applied to the driver of the horse carriage) to cars. Courts mainly used negligence rules, premised on driver's control of vehicle. Horse carriage rules readily applied because they were analogous - no need for special consideration. Because the rules were analogous, courts could adapt existing legal principles rather than creating entirely new frameworks. This demonstrates how existing legal principles can be adapted to new technologies when the situations are analogous.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect. The 'law of the metal horse' was not created immediately with no connection to horse carriage rules. Rather, courts applied existing horse carriage rules (like the word 'driver' and negligence rules) to cars because they were analogous.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "This is too narrow. The 'law of the metal horse' includes not just traffic laws, but the entire framework including liability rules, insurance schemes, and other legal systems surrounding automobiles.",
          "D": "This is incorrect. The 'law of the metal horse' was not created by manufacturers. Rather, it developed through court decisions applying existing legal principles and through legislative responses (like compulsory insurance) to address the rise in accidents."

      "question": "According to the automobile case study, why was regulation necessary in addition to liability rules?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Liability rules were completely ineffective and never worked for automobile accidents.",
        "B": "Liability proved insufficient given the rise in accidents and judgment-proof defendants; people could win lawsuits but never get their money back because defendants were too rich/powerful or too poor to care about the judgment, so regulation (like compulsory insurance) was necessary.",
        "C": "Regulation was necessary because courts refused to apply liability rules to automobile accidents.",
        "D": "Regulation was necessary only for commercial vehicles, not private cars."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "According to the automobile case study, regulation was necessary in addition to liability because liability proved insufficient given the rise in accidents and judgment-proof defendants. People could win their lawsuits but never get their money back - defendants were judgment-proof, being too rich/powerful or too poor to care about the judgment. This created a legal disconnect between existing laws and new social issues caused by the technology, so regulation was thought to be necessary. The first mover was the UK (ahead of US), which passed the Road Traffic Acts of 1930s, introducing compulsory insurance. Compensation was still premised on proof of negligence, but the insurance scheme ensured that costs fell not upon funds derived largely from the generosity of the charitable, but on those by whom in equity it should be borne by compelling motorists to pay regular premiums. As technology developed, more and more regulation (highway codes, etc.) was added.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is too absolute. Liability rules did work in theory, but the problem was practical - judgment-proof defendants meant victims couldn't recover even when they won. The rules themselves weren't ineffective, but enforcement/recovery was problematic.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "This is incorrect. Courts did apply liability rules to automobile accidents - they applied negligence rules premised on driver's control. The problem wasn't that courts refused to apply liability, but that liability alone was insufficient due to judgment-proof defendants.",
          "D": "This is too narrow. The Road Traffic Acts introduced compulsory insurance for motorists generally, not just commercial vehicles. The regulation addressed the general problem of judgment-proof defendants in automobile accidents."

      "question": "According to Jerrold's paper on automated vehicles, what is 'driver-centricity' and how did it emerge?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Driver-centricity means that drivers are always at fault in accidents, with no exceptions.",
        "B": "Driver-centricity can be unpacked into two layers: first, drivers are central in law as the focal point of tort liability; second, drivers are central in practice because compulsory insurance identifies them as the first parties victims consider suing; this emerged from the search for practical, fair, and efficient means of victim compensation in light of a negligence-based regime inherited from the days of the horse and buggy.",
        "C": "Driver-centricity means that only drivers can be held liable, never manufacturers or other parties.",
        "D": "Driver-centricity emerged from manufacturers' desire to avoid liability, with no connection to insurance or compensation schemes."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "According to Jerrold's paper, 'driver-centricity' can be unpacked into two layers: (1) First, drivers are central in law as the focal point of tort liability. The natural person to owe the negligence duty was the driver. With liability centered on the driver, insurance obligations followed. (2) Second, drivers are central in practice because compulsory insurance identifies them as the first parties victims consider suing, possibly even if the accident was caused by manufacturing defects. The layers interact. Denning MR in Nettleship v Weston suggested that judges had, since the Road Traffic Acts, become more willing to pin negligence liability on drivers, even in the absence of fault, because this better accorded with the policy of compulsory insurance. Driver-centricity emerged from the search for practical, fair, and efficient means of victim compensation in light of a negligence-based regime inherited from the days of the horse and buggy. Driver-centricity emerged from the transitional period where an untested new technology (car) gradually replaced a familiar one (horse).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is too absolute. Driver-centricity doesn't mean drivers are always at fault. Rather, it means drivers are the focal point of liability analysis and insurance schemes, but fault must still be proven under negligence principles.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "This is too absolute. Driver-centricity doesn't mean only drivers can be held liable. Rather, it means drivers are the primary focal point, but other parties (like manufacturers) can still be liable. The point is that drivers are the first parties victims consider suing due to compulsory insurance.",
          "D": "This mischaracterizes the emergence. Driver-centricity didn't emerge from manufacturers' desire to avoid liability.

        "A": "Lessig's theory didn't apply to automobiles because cars are physical objects, not cyberspace.",
        "B": "Lessig's theory plays out nearly note for note - social norms (stigma around jaywalking, victim-blaming), real space architecture (roads, freeways, parking spaces, sidewalks), and laws (jaywalking became illegal) all changed to favor driving over walking, demonstrating how all four modalities (market, law, norms, architecture) interacted to regulate behavior.",

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "According to the 'Criminalizing walking; subsidizing driving' article, Lessig's theory plays out nearly note for note in the automobile context. Social norms changed: stigma around jaywalking (essentially a kind of victim-blaming), claim that 'Jaywalkers are causing most of the incidents!', traffic collisions branded as 'accidents' (the narrative that it's no one's fault). Real space architecture evolved: roads and freeways became the norm, parking spaces took over cities, pedestrians (once free to walk anywhere) were relegated to the sidewalk. Laws also changed: jaywalking became illegal and widely-enforced, sometimes against disadvantaged groups. This demonstrates how all four modalities (market, law, norms, architecture) interacted to regulate behavior in favor of driving over walking. The lesson is that as we move on to more 'newly urgent' cases, we should be able to spot parallels to the past.",

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "According to the notes, IP (Internet Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) work together in the protocol stack but have different functions. IP directs packets to a specific computer using an IP address. IP is an unreliable, connectionless protocol - IP doesn't care whether a packet gets to its destination or not, nor does IP know about connections and port numbers. IP's job is to send and route packets to other computers. TCP is responsible for routing application protocols to the correct application on the destination computer using port numbers. Each application on a computer listens on a different port. When a packet arrives, the TCP layer decides which application receives the packet based on the port number of the incoming packet. TCP is connection-oriented, reliable, and includes error-checking. Unlike TCP, IP is unreliable and connectionless - it is TCP's job to make sure packets arrive and are in the correct order.",

There is a DNS database spread across multiple DNS servers that keeps a record of which URL points to which IP address. Home computers normally require a DNS server to be named in the setup process, so that the browser knows where to look for the domain names to get the IP address. When you type a URL into a web browser, if the URL contains a domain name, the browser first connects to a domain name server and retrieves the corresponding IP address for the web server.

This is seen in TCP/IP - the protocol just delivers packets without worrying about what they do or who they're meant for. This enables people to innovate for the network without coordinating with any network owner. This encourages innovation and competition (prevents network owners from denying access strategically). These architectural features embed certain values. These values can change, and if they do, the values the Internet promotes will be different. The architecture matters - the same application of 'real-life code' has also affected behavior (e.g., DRM technology to prevent copyright infringement). The point is that architectures matter, and the Internet's architecture embeds values of simplicity, edge intelligence, and innovation without coordination.",

        "correct": "According to Lessig's examples, different cyberspace architectures embed different values and enable different forms of regulation. AOL: when you are on AOL, you are subject to the rules of its world - it knows certain things about who you are, makes it harder for other users to know who you are, and it constrains the size of chat rooms making it more difficult for dissidents to organize. If AOL wants to control behavior, it can impose rules, tax the behavior, or change the architecture/code completely to render that behavior impossible. Counsel Connect: an online lawyers' cooperative that used real names (social pressure and responsibility), forced all discussions into threads (forces people to read before speaking), and built reputation within the community tied to real names. This enabled regulation through norms more than code - behavior was more regulable by norms than in AOL. LambdaMOO: an open space where someone did horrible stuff, and community members had to determine whether to turn to vigilantism or institute rules via democracy - the system had failed to self-regulate, and users had to come up with internal norms.

This was not meant to disturb tort liability principles, as victims were still to prove negligence before being entitled to compensation. The scheme addressed the problem that negligence alone was unsatisfactory because accident victims commonly overcame costly litigation only to find tortfeasors insolvent and judgment-proof. The insurance scheme ensured that when victims proved negligence and won their lawsuits, they could actually recover compensation from the insurance company, rather than being unable to collect from judgment-proof defendants.

(3) The client will send an SMTP HELO command to which the server will respond with a 250 OK message. (4) Depending on whether the client is checking mail, sending mail, etc., the appropriate SMTP commands will be sent to the server, which will respond accordingly.

The point is that the system had failed to self-regulate, and users had to come up with a set of internal norms to govern themselves. This demonstrates that self-regulation doesn't always work automatically - sometimes communities need to consciously develop norms and rules when the system fails to self-regulate. LambdaMOO shows a different approach than AOL (code-based control) or Counsel Connect (norm-based through architecture) - it shows a community that had to develop its own regulatory framework when the initial open system failed.

Horse carriage rules readily applied because they were analogous - no need for special consideration. This shows Easterbrook's 'Law of the Horse' principle in action - existing legal principles can be adapted. However, the case study also shows that liability alone may be insufficient. Liability proved insufficient given the rise in accidents and judgment-proof defendants. People could win lawsuits but never get their money back. This created a legal disconnect between existing laws and new social issues caused by the technology, so regulation (like compulsory insurance) was necessary.

Thus, Counsel Connect enabled regulation through modalities other than code - behavior was more regulable by norms than in AOL.

When a router doesn't know where to send a packet, it sends the packet on a default route, usually up the hierarchy to the next router. If still not found, it sends further up until it reaches a NSP backbone. The routers connected to the NSP backbones hold the largest routing tables, and the packet will be routed to the correct backbone and is sent downwards until it arrives at the destination. This hierarchical approach is efficient - smaller routers don't need complete routing information, they just need to know their local networks and how to send packets up the hierarchy.
