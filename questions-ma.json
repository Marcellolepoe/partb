    "question": "TechStart Pte Ltd (a private company) is acquiring InnovateCorp Pte Ltd (a public company) for S$50 million. The acquisition will be structured as a share purchase, and TechStart plans to finance the acquisition through a combination of: (1) S$20 million from its own cash reserves, (2) S$25 million from a bank loan secured against InnovateCorp's assets, and (3) S$5 million from InnovateCorp's cash reserves (which InnovateCorp will lend to TechStart). The company's legal advisor is assessing the transaction structure. Which of the following statements about the legal issues may apply?",
    "statements": [
      "I. The S$25 million bank loan secured against InnovateCorp's assets violates section 76 of the Companies Act as it constitutes financial assistance.",
      "II. The S$5 million loan from InnovateCorp to TechStart violates section 76 as it constitutes financial assistance for the acquisition of InnovateCorp's own shares.",
      "III. The transaction structure is permissible as InnovateCorp is a public company and section 76 only applies to private companies.",
      "IV. The bank loan is permissible as it is secured against InnovateCorp's assets but not provided by InnovateCorp itself.",
      "V. The transaction requires shareholder approval under section 160 as it involves the disposal of substantially the whole of InnovateCorp's property."

GlobalCorp only wants the software development business. The company's legal advisor is recommending the optimal acquisition structure. Which of the following statements about the acquisition structure may apply?",
    "statements": [
      "I. A share purchase is preferable as it is simpler to execute and requires fewer consents from third parties.",
