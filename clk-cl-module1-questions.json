      "question": "What core feature distinguishes civil law systems from common law systems, according to the notes?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Civil law systems rely primarily on judicial precedent, while common law systems rely on codified statutes.",
        "B": "Civil law systems are built on comprehensive codified statutes drawn from sources like Roman law, with the codes serving as the primary source of law, whereas common law relies more heavily on judge-made precedent alongside statutes.",
        "C": "Civil law systems prohibit codification, relying solely on customary practices.",
        "D": "Common law systems do not recognise statutes at all." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Civil law originated in continental Europe and centres on codified law. Practitioners first consult the relevant code, which categorises legal relationships and aims to be comprehensive. Common law, although statutory, is heavily shaped by precedent and iterative judicial development.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This reverses the roles of precedent and codes in the two systems.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Civil law emphasises codification rather than forbidding it.",
          "D": "Common law jurisdictions enact statutes; precedent complements them."

      "question": "How does the persuasive force of case law operate in civil law jurisdictions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Single decisions bind future courts through stare decisis, just like in common law.",
        "B": "Case law has persuasive value that increases with uniformity; when a consistent line of decisions (constant jurisprudence) emerges, later courts give it considerable authoritative weight, but no single judgment is formally binding.",
        "C": "Case law is entirely irrelevant and never considered.",
        "D": "Civil law courts must follow foreign precedents before local codes." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Absent stare decisis, civil law judges consult past decisions only when there is sufficient uniformity. A coherent trend (constant jurisprudence) exerts significant persuasive influence, while competing decisions carry little weight.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Stare decisis does not apply in civil law systems.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Courts do consider consistent case law to guide interpretation.",
          "D": "Domestic codes remain the primary source; foreign precedents are not prioritised."

      "question": "What is meant by 'constant jurisprudence' in the French civil law tradition?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A single appellate decision that binds all lower courts.",
        "B": "A threshold of consistent case law such that when positive judgments exceed it, future recognition of similar claims is facilitated; when negative judgments dominate, claims become harder to sustain.",
        "C": "The practice of ignoring all prior decisions when interpreting the code.",
        "D": "A constitutional requirement that courts sit in constant session." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Constant jurisprudence reflects the accumulation of consistent decisions on a legal issue. Once positive rulings predominate, future claims gain traction; conversely, a predominance of negative rulings constrains recognition.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "No single decision has binding force in civil law.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Past decisions can guide interpretation when consistent.",
          "D": "The term relates to jurisprudence, not court sittings."

      "question": "Why is the codified nature of civil law intended to be comprehensive?",
      "options": {
        "A": "So that judges never have to interpret ambiguous provisions.",
        "B": "Because civil codes aim to specify all matters that can come before a court, including procedures, penalties, and remedies, ensuring practitioners can locate governing rules within the code itself.",
        "C": "Because legislatures in civil law countries cannot pass new statutes once a code exists.",
        "D": "Because civil codes are meant only for criminal law." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Civil codes categorise legal relationships and provide exhaustive coverage so that judges and lawyers can resolve disputes by consulting the relevant provisions without relying on unwritten law. Codes are periodically updated to maintain completeness.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Codes still require interpretation; ambiguity can arise.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Legislatures can enact supplementary statutes to override or update code sections.",
          "D": "Civil codes span private, commercial, and procedural law, not just criminal matters."

      "question": "How do civil law practitioners typically approach a new legal issue?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They first search for analogous common law precedents.",
        "B": "They begin with the relevant code provision(s), since the code is designed to cover the issue, and only later consider case law or doctrine for interpretation if necessary.",
        "C": "They ignore written law and focus on customary practice first.",
        "D": "They always defer to the highest court's most recent judgment." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Because the code is the primary legal source, civil law lawyers consult it before looking to case law, scholarly commentary, or custom. Only when ambiguity persists do they rely on secondary interpretive aids.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Common law precedents are not the first reference point.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Custom may inform interpretation but does not usually precede the code.",
          "D": "No single judgment binds future cases; the code remains central."

      "question": "Why does the lack of official Indonesian-language codification create difficulties?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Because the Dutch text was destroyed and cannot be consulted.",
        "B": "Because the authoritative version remains in Dutch, so judges and lawyers lacking Dutch proficiency struggle; amendments must also be made in Dutch, discouraging updates and prompting legislators to pass overriding statutes instead.",
        "C": "Because Indonesian courts refuse to use any translation under all circumstances.",
        "D": "Because the code has been fully translated into English instead." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Indonesia's civil code inherits Dutch language. Many provisions remain untranslated, legal scholarship relies on historical Dutch commentators, and amendments in Dutch are impractical, leading to piecemeal statutory overrides.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "The Dutch text still exists; the issue is language accessibility.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Courts may use translations, but the official authority lies with the Dutch version.",

      "question": "Why do civil law jurisdictions often rely on legal scholars for interpretation?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Because scholars, not judges, draft binding regulations.",
        "B": "Because the breadth of codified provisions and historical commentaries (e.g., Dutch scholars for Indonesia) provide authoritative insights that courts consult when applying the code.",
        "C": "Because scholars issue binding precedents.",
        "D": "Because legal education replaces judicial reasoning." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Civil law scholarship (doctrine) offers structured analysis of code provisions and aids courts in interpreting text, especially where language or historical context makes direct application challenging, as seen in Indonesia's reliance on Dutch commentaries.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Scholars interpret but do not draft binding rules.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Precedents remain judicial; scholars provide persuasive doctrine.",

      "question": "What is the significance of implementing regulations in civil law systems like Indonesia?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They are optional policy documents with no legal effect.",
        "B": "They serve as supplementary legislation issued by ministries or agencies to clarify procedures and details under statutes, and delays in issuance can create interim uncertainty that requires ministerial consultation.",
        "C": "They replace the need for statutory codes entirely.",
        "D": "They are unique to common law jurisdictions." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Implementing regulations flesh out statutory schemes (e.g., toll road tariffs, language requirements). Until promulgated, stakeholders may face ambiguity and must interact with agencies cautiously to understand intended application.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "They have binding effect within their scope.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "They complement, not replace, statutory law.",

      "question": "How do civil law jurisdictions handle overlapping or supplemental legislation relative to the civil code?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They prohibit any statutes outside the civil code.",
        "B": "They frequently enact specialised statutes (e.g., agrarian law, marriage law, company law) that override or supplement code provisions, recognising that the code does not cover every specific domain.",
        "C": "They require the civil code to be amended for every new policy.",
        "D": "They rely solely on customary law without statutory updates." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Indonesia and Thailand illustrate how legislatures adopt specialised acts for specific areas (real property, marriage, company law). These acts coexist with the code, updating or replacing sections without rewriting the entire code.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Supplementary statutes are common.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "C": "Amending the code is difficult; statutes often override instead.",

      "options": {
        "A": "Courts automatically suspend the statute until regulations appear.",
        "B": "Stakeholders face uncertainty about procedural details and may need to consult ministries, recognising that guidance is unofficial until regulations issue.",
        "C": "The statute is invalidated by the constitutional court.",
        "D": "Parties may freely disregard the statute." 
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Until implementing regulations clarify the statute's scope and procedures, businesses and practitioners must rely on interim guidance and cautious engagement with agencies, as exemplified by the toll road and language laws in Indonesia.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "Statutes remain in force; courts may still apply them.",
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",

      "question": "Why do Indonesian legislators often enact new statutes instead of amending the Civil Code directly?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Because the code forbids any amendment whatsoever.",
        "B": "Because amendments must be drafted in Dutch—the authoritative language—making updates cumbersome, so legislators override provisions (e.g., agrarian or marriage law) with new statutes in Indonesian.",
        "C": "Because courts refuse to apply statutory amendments.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {

      "options": {
        "A": "It immediately provided complete guidance on consequence of non-compliance.",
        "B": "It mandated Indonesian language versions but was silent on consequences, leading to Supreme Court decisions annulling foreign-language contracts until implementing regulation (2019) and a 2023 circular clarified annulment depends on bad faith.",
