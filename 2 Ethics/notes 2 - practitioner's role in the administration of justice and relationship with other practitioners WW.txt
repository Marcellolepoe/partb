b. Reason for advance notice: It avoids a situation where only one party is allowed to be present while the other party is not => In matrimonial proceedings, this can be easily perceived by an emotional party that the other party’s one-sided presence at the chamber hearings is unfair 

When should an appeal be filed? 
Grant of leave to apply by lower Court merely provides opportunity to appeal => Lawyer still has duty to consider whether an appeal should be filed 
Lam Hwa Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v Yang Qiang 
- Grant of leave to appeal by a lower Court merely provides the opportunity for lawyers and client to pursue a matter further but it does not displace:
a. Whether consequences of filing appeal justify expense and risk: The lawyer’s duty to assess whether the consequence of pursuing the appeal justifies the expense and risk involved 
b. Whether filing appeal will be in overall interests of administration of justice: The lawyer’s duty to assess whether it would be in the overall interests of the administration of justice to pursue the appeal 

3-stage framework for lawyers who intend to file appeal for low value claims 
Lam Hwa Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v Yang Qiang 
- 3-stage framework for lawyers who intend to bring low value claims through the appeal process:
1. First – Assess whether appeal has legal merit bearing in mind the value of claim: Lawyers must assess whether client’s case has legal merit bearing in mind the amount at stake 
2. Second – Assess whether consequence of appeal justifies expense or risk involved: Lawyers must conduct a proper risk-benefit evaluation with their client and consider if the consequence of a matter justifies the expense or risk involved 
3. Third – If cost is disproportionate but client still wants to go ahead, assess if the arguments on appeal have considerable force: If the cost is disproportionate, lawyers must closely and carefully review the merits of pursuing an appeal in light of the disproportionate cost => Lawyer should only pursue appeal if there is considerable force in arguments raised on appeal 

Lam Hwa Engineering 
- Held: 
1. Lawyer was wrong to pursue the appeal in this case and had caused the client to incur costs which are grossly out of proportion to the sum at stake: 
a. Only a modest sum of $1208 in disbursements was at stake
b. Fully reasoned grounds had already been given by the district court judge and high court judge 
2. However, if the client felt that he wanted to pursue a point of principle even in light of the disproportionate cost, the lawyer can do so if he closely and carefully reviews the merits of an appeal in light of the two previous written judgements and authorities and must be satisfied that there was considerable force in its position before filing and pursuing the appeal 

(n) **Proper and Honest Evaluation about Client’s Case 
Duty can be found in a few different rules: Rule 5(2)(b), 5(2)(c), 9(2)(e), 17(2)(a), 17(2)(e)
Rule 5(2)(b) of PCR 
- A legal practitioner must when advising client, inform client of all information known to the legal practitioner that may reasonably affect the interests of the client in the matter 

Rule 5(2)(c) of PCR
- A legal practitioner must act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to the client 

Rule 9(2)(e) of PCR

Duty is owed to Client and the Court 
Zhou Tong v PP 
- There are 2 parts to a lawyer’s duty to carefully assess the merits of the client’s case before commencing proceedings: 
(i) Lawyer’s duty owed to clients: Lawyers who recklessly institute legal proceedings without considering the merits of their client’s case essentially improperly take their client’s money and abuse the client’s trust and confidence in them 
(ii) Lawyer’s duty owed to the Court: Lawyers who pursue appeals without adequately considering the merits of the client’s case would be misusing the Court’s time

Standard required to discharge duty 
Zhou Tong v PP
- Test: Whether the lawyer had faithfully and diligently directed his mind to the facts of his client’s case and the applicable law => If lawyer makes the effort to consider and evaluate all pertinent aspects of their client’s case, it does not matter if the Court ultimately determines there is no merit  

Case Law Example – Failure to provide proper and honest evaluation of case
Lock Han Chng Jonathan v Goh Jessiline – Lawyer failure to advise client to settle dispute over $60 with minimum fuss and cost 
- Lawyer should evaluate with his client whether the consequence of a matter justifies the expense and risk involved in going to Court 
- Held: 
1. Counsel of both parties got called out by the Court:
2. There was no high principal at stake and only a paltry sum of $60 was involved 
3. Both counsel did not advise their clients to settle the dispute with minimum fuss and cost but proceeded to broaden areas of contention unnecessarily and in a highly wasteful manner

(o) Duty to Assist the Court 
Lam Hwa Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v Yang Qiang 
- Lawyer has a duty to avoid unnecessary adjournments, expense and waste of the Court’s time 
- Lawyer has a duty to assist the Court in ensuring a speedy and efficient trial and in arriving at a just decision 

Zhou Tong v PP – Lawyer wasting Court’s time 
- Lawyer had, without prior leave of Court, unilaterally decided to depart from the procedural requirement to file written skeletal arguments 
- Lawyer also knew at an earlier date that four of the appellants could not be contacted but had failed to inform the court and the PP of this until the appeal was heard 
- Held: 
1. Lawyer was strongly berated because his conduct was prejudicial to the efficient and orderly disposal of cases

(p) Duty not to deceive or mislead the Court 
Duty can be found in Rule 9(2)(a), 9(2)(b), 9(2)(c), 9(2)(f), 9(2)(g), 9(3)

When can a lawyer properly disbelieve client?
Principle 1: Lawyers should not disbelieve client unless lawyer has personal knowledge that instructions are false, OR client’s statements are inherently incredible or logically impossible (if so lawyer OUGHT to know that instructions are false)
Wee Soon Kim Anthony v LSS
- Lawyer should not disbelieve his client’s instructions unless:
a. He himself has personal knowledge of the matter
b. His client’s statements are inherently incredible or logically impossible 

Principle 2: Lawyers should believe client’s evidence even if it conflicts with evidence from opposing party => Lawyer should only disbelieve client’s evidence when it conflicts with incontrovertible evidence or documents 
Bachoo Mohan Singh v PP 
- Lawyers should be allowed to act on their client’s instructions even in the face of conflicting evidence from the opposing party and should only refuse when the instructions fly in the face of incontrovertible evidence or documents 
a. Unless lawyer has personal knowledge that the instructions are false 
b. Or if the instructions are inherently incredible or logically impossible, such that counsel ought to know that the instructions are false 
a. Reason: Lawyers are not fact-finders and should not act as a pre-trial sieve for their own client 
- Lawyer should decline to accept instructions if they plainly appear to be without foundation i.e. lacking in logic or legal coherence 

Principle 3: Lawyers have no ethical duty to verify client’s instructions with other sources unless there are compelling reasons to indicate that client’s instructions are dubious 
Bachoo Mohan Singh v PP
- Lawyer has no ethical duty to verify his client’s instructions with other sources unless there are compelling reasons to indicate that they are dubious => However, if there are no reasonable means of objectively assessing whether the instructions have foundation then the lawyer would not be faulted for proceeding 

Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew 
- It would be an unduly onerous duty in every instance to verify the truth of what clients have deposed to in affidavits => Lawyer should not disbelieve client’s instructions unless client’s statements are inherently incredible or logically impossible 

*(C) DUTY TO SUPERVISE DISCLOSURE PROCESS
Teo Wai Cheong v Credit Industriel et commercial 
- Lawyers have a duty to the Court to properly explain to their clients what the discovery obligations are 
- Lawyers also have a duty to the court to be involved in and to supervise the disclosure process 
- This duty is more onerous than simply informing the client of the provisions governing discovery 
- Facts: bank failed to disclose documents. Court commented that solicitors for the bank may not have taken all the steps they ought to have in discharging their duty in disclosure. Solicitors’ emails to the bank merely informed it of the provisions regarding discovery, which is insufficient to discharge the solicitors’ duty in discovery
- In practice, lawyers have a duty to:
a. Review documents disclosed, AND
b. Investigate further if solicitor believes that relevant documents have been omitted 
i. Especially if the solicitor knows/ought to know how a corporate client works 
c. Explain discovery obligations to any in the corporation who might be affected by them, if the client is a corporation
Standard of duty
- If client claims that he has no documents than whatever he has already disclose => But Lawyer has reasonable grounds for supposing that there are other documents => Lawyer ought to investigate the matter 
- Lawyer has to carefully go through the documents disclosed to ensure that no relevant documents have been omitted 
- It is insufficient to simply inform client of the disclosure requirements under ROC 

Standard of duty when advising a corporation

- Lawyer should visit the corporation to gain insight as to how business is administered, how and when documents are generated and the personalities of people involved in the matter 

If client does not want to cooperate with discovery => Lawyer should cease to act 
- If lawyer cannot get client to cooperate with discovery, the lawyer should cease to act for the client 
Global Distressed Alpha Fund 
- Lawyers have a duty to disclose all material facts
* Lawyers should not only emphasize material facts favorable to them 
* Lawyers should not fail to mention material facts favorable to the other party or fail to adequately bring them to the Court’s attention 

(D) DUTY OF CANDOUR OWED TO THE COURT / DUTY NOT TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
LSS v de Souza Christopher James
Rule 10(3)(a) PCR – lawyers must prevent his client from, must not be a party to, and must not assist the client in suppressing evidence.

Mr Christopher James de Souza (“Mr de Souza”) was found by a Council of the Law Society disciplinary tribunal (“DT”) to be guilty of the charge of being a party to and assisting his client in suppressing evidence, in breach of rule 10(3)(a) of the PCR (the “Charge”). The Law Society subsequently applied for Mr de Souza to be sanctioned under the LPA. 

However, this application was dismissed by Court of Three Supreme Court Judges (“C3J”) in Law Society of Singapore v de Souza Christopher James [2024] 3 SLR 1570. The C3J held that intention was a necessary ingredient of such a charge, and further that Mr de Souza’s actions in representing his client did not come from an intent to assist Amber in suppressing evidence. Further, a key affidavit which Mr De Souza was involved in preparing (“Sudesh’s 29/1/19 Affidavit”), objectively construed, did not in fact suppress evidence. As such, the Charge against Mr de Souza was not made out and Mr de Souza was not to be sanctioned for breaching rule 10(3)(a) of the PCR.


(E) CLIENT IS ABOUT TO GIVE/HAS GIVEN FALSE EVIDENCE TO COURT => LAWYER HAS DUTY TO CEASE ACTING OR TO CONTINUE ACTING BUT NOT TO PERPETUATE FALSEHOOD – RULE 10(4)
Rule 10(4) 
- If lawyer knows client is about to give or has given false evidence to Court: Where a legal practitioner knows that his or her client is about to give, or has given, false evidence or false information to a court or tribunal, the legal practitioner must:
a. Lawyer must cease to act for client; OR
b. Lawyer can continue acting but must not perpetuate falsehood: If the legal practitioner continues to act for the client, conduct the client’s case in a manner that does not perpetuate the falsehood

(F) ADVICE IS SOUGHT FOR ANY DISHONEST, FRAUDULENT OR UNLAWFUL PURPOSE – RULE 10(5)
Rule 10(5)
- A legal practitioner must not render to his or her client any advice which the legal practitioner knows or has reasonable grounds to believe is sought by the client for any dishonest, fraudulent or unlawful purpose.

Principle 1: Subjective-Objective method of inquiry to determine if lawyer knew his advice was being sought for an unlawful purpose 
LSS v Leong Pek Gan 
- Step 1: Court must assume the position of the actual lawyer involved including his knowledge and experience
- Step 2: Court must assess whether an objective reasonable person from the position of the actual lawyer and from the facts known to the actual lawyer would know that the advice was being sought for an unlawful purpose 

LSS v Leong Pek Gan – Several aspects of transaction were highly unusual and Lawyer should have known that his advice would be used for unlicensed moneylending transactions  
- Lawyer in this case acted for the parties on both sides of an unlicensed moneylending transaction and preferred the moneylender’s interests in the process
- Lawyer had reasonable grounds to believe that the transaction involved unlicensed moneylending as several aspects of the transaction were highly unusual 
- Lawyer charged under s83(2)(b) or s83(2)(h)

(G) DUTY TO PREVENT IMPROPRIETY OF CLIENT – RULE 10(6) 
Rule 10(6)

- Lawyer acted in conjunction with his client to corruptly solicit for his client’s family a gratification of 100k from the family of his counterpart in exchange for the client exonerating the counterpart via the client’s signed confession 
- Lawyer assisted client in getting a bribe in return for a confession and he was convicted under s5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (12 months’ imprisonment) and struck off the roll 
- As a senior member of the Bar and a former police officer, the court held that the lawyer should have been all the more keenly aware of the need to guard against any abuse of the justice system. His conduct was shocking and reprehensible.
- Assisting in a client’s impropriety would color the conduct of the solicitor himself 

(H) LAWYER HAS NO DUTY TO INFORM POLICE OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION ABOUT PARTIES 
=> But duty to inform Court if it is relevant to the matter
PD 1.6.2 
Fact Pattern:
- Legal practitioner acting for a woman who wishes to petition for the divorce of her husband. Legal practitioner discovers that husband was guilty of committing the offense of bigamy. 

Question: Was the legal practitioner bound to lay criminal information against the husband before proceeding with the divorce suit? 
- Lay information: Inform the police/court 

Guidance:
- Legal practitioner was under no obligation to lay information of bigamy having been committed by the husband before proceeding with the divorce petition
- However, in the divorce petition, the legal practitioner was bound to disclose all facts within his knowledge and that would include the fact that the husband was guilty of bigamy

c. Any allegation of fraud, unless the legal practitioner has clear instructions to make such an allegation and has before the legal practitioner reasonably credible material which establishes a prima facie case of fraud 
d. For case of an affidavit or a witness statement, any statement of fact which the witness making the affidavit or witness statement would not give if it was given orally 

Bachoo Mohan Singh v PP 
- Lawyers should be allowed to act on their client’s instructions even in the face of conflicting evidence from the opposing party and should only refuse when the instructions fly in the face of incontrovertible evidence or documents 
a. Reason: Lawyers are not fact-finders and should not act as a pre-trial sieve for their own client 
- Lawyer should decline to accept instructions if they plainly appear to be without foundation i.e. lacking in logic or legal coherence 
a. If there are no reasonable means of objectively assessing whether the instructions have foundation then the lawyer would not be faulted for proceeding 
- Lawyer has no ethical duty to verify his client’s instructions with other sources unless there are compelling reasons to indicate that they are dubious 

Wee Soon Kim Anthony v LSS
- Lawyer should not disbelieve his client’s instructions unless:

Teo Wai Cheong v Credit Industriel et commercial 
- Lawyers have a duty to the Court to properly explain to their clients what the discovery obligations are

b. Lawyer has to carefully go through the documents disclosed to ensure that no relevant documents have been omitted 
c. It is insufficient to simply inform client of the disclosure requirements under O 24 ROC 
- When lawyers advise a corporation, the lawyer has a duty to ensure that knowledge and appreciation of the scope of the discovery obligations must be passed to anybody in the corporation who might be affected by it: 
a. Lawyer should visit the corporation to gain insight as to how business is administered, how and when documents are generated and the personalities of people involved in the matter 
- If lawyer cannot get client to cooperate with discovery, the lawyer should cease to act for the client 


*(3) Conflict of interest in proceedings before court or tribunal (RULE 11)
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING RULE 11 PCR
Rule 11(1) of PCR 
a. Lawyer duty to advance interests of client and to present client’s best case => But subject to Lawyer’s duties as an officer of the Court: A legal practitioner’s duty to advance the interests of the legal practitioner’s client and to present the client’s best possible case, is subject to the legal practitioner’s duties as an officer of the Court and to assist in the administration of justice 

DUTY TO NOT APPEAR BEFORE COURT IF LAWYER IS IN CONFLICT OF INTEREST – RULE 11(2)
Rule 11(2)
- A legal practitioner must not appear before a Court or tribunal in a matter where: 
a. Duty to not appear if lawyer cannot maintain professional independence because of commercial, family, personal or any relationship with client: It would be difficult for the legal practitioner to maintain the legal practitioner’s professional independence by reason of any commercial, family, personal or other relationship between the legal practitioner and his client; or 
b. Duty to not appear if there might be apparent bias because of lawyer’s relationship with the Court: The impartial administration of justice might or might appear to be prejudiced by reason of the legal practitioner’s relationship with the Court or tribunal or any member of the Court or tribunal 

**DUTY TO NOT ACT FOR CLIENT IN CASE, IF LAWYER IS REQUIRED TO GIVE EVIDENCE MATERIAL TO THE CASE (LAWYER CANNOT BE WITNESS AND ACT FOR PARTY IN SAME CASE) – RULE 11(3)(A)
Rule 11(3)(a) 
- If lawyer must give evidence material to a case -: In any case where it is known or it appears that a legal practitioner will be required to give evidence which is material to the determination of any contested issue before a court or tribunal:
* The legal practitioner:
(i) Lawyer must not accept instructions from any party to that case: Must not accept instructions from any party to that case; and
(ii) If lawyer was acting for any party to that case, Lawyer must discharge himself: Must, if the legal practitioner was acting for any party to that case, discharge himself or herself, or, where the legal practitioner has represented that party in any proceedings relating to that case, apply to be discharged, from acting further for that party; but

PD rules: If lawyer will be a witness for material/disputed question of fact => Lawyer cannot be representing any party 
PD 1.7.1 
- Legal practitioner shall not represent any party in any case which he has reason to believe that he will be a witness in respect of a material and disputed question of fact 
a. Lawyer should discharge himself: If it becomes apparent that he will be such a witness during proceedings, then he should discharge himself and take all reasonable steps to ensure that he does not jeopardize his client’s interests 
- Legal practitioner shall not appear before an appellate tribunal if in the case under appeal, he has been a witness on a material and disputed question of fact in the court below 

Alternative: Another lawyer in same law practice can continue to represent any party to that case unless doing so would *prejudice administration of justice
Rule 11(3)(b)
- The law practice in which the legal practitioner practices, or a member of that law practice, may represent or continue to represent any party to that case, unless doing so would prejudice the administration of justice.

Rule 11 is for protection of the client and the client must be the aggrieved party when alleging that his lawyer has breached Rule 11
Then Khek Khoon v Arjun Permanand Samtani --> solicitor’s own interest cannot conflict with the interests of the client and the court
- Reason for duty: Protection of client and the client must be the aggrieved party when his lawyer breaches this duty
a. Implication: This rule is not supposed to be invoked by the opposing counsel 
- E.g. of Conflict: Where an uninformed or disadvantaged client has been grossly overcharged by his lawyer => Lawyer cannot represent the client in proceedings brought against himself for fees charged => Proper procedure would be: 
a. Lawyer must reveal the interests to the client with “complete frankness”
b. Client must receive independent advice from another lawyer or other appropriate surveyors 

- Pfs argue that they had suffered loss and damage in the form of 752.6k of solicitor and client costs payable to the Pf’s lawyers. Df challenged the quantum of the costs. Df argues that the Pf’s lawyers should be restrained from representing the Pf as the Pf’s lawyers were in a conflict of interest between their own interest and the Pf’s interests. 
- Court said no conflict as Pf and Pf’s lawyers had aligned interests in establishing the reasonableness of the costs
- Principle – there are no rigid rules or criteria to be laid down. **So long as the subconscious shaping of evidence is of concern, and the issues envelop the entire firm, then there might be prejudice to the administration of justice. 
a. Is there a degree of loss of objectivity for the lawyer? 

Case Law Example – Seems to contradict Rule 11(3)(b) 
Ho Kon Kim v Betsy Lim Gek Kim
- Lawyer firm previously acted for the Pf in the sale of a property and mortgage to a bank. Dispute broke out between the Pf and the Df who is a party in the transaction. Conveyancing partner of the firm knew that he would be a material witness in the proceedings against the Df. Litigation partner of the firm continued to act for the Pf in the proceedings.
- Conflict because both material witness in the proceedings and the counsel are from the same firm 
- High Court observed that the firm should have ceased acting for the Pf immediately 
- SGCA commented that both lawyers should have discharged themselves from acting for Pf and advise her to seek independent legal advice:
a. Both lawyers knew that conveyancing partner would be a material witness
b. Both lawyers had a personal interest in the case as their firm had previously acted for the Pf in the transaction from which the dispute arose  


(4) Communications and dealings with witnesses (RULE 12)
Principles underlying Rule 12 PCR 
Rule 12(1) of PCR 
a. Lawyer must ensure he acts in a manner consistent with administration of justice when dealing with any witness regardless of effect of evidence given by witness: A legal practitioner must ensure that he acts in a manner consistent with the administration of justice when dealing with any witness, regardless of the effect or potential effect of the evidence given or to be given by that witness
b. Lawyer must exercise own judgement as to substance and form of questions put to witnesses: A legal practitioner must exercise the legal practitioner’s own judgement both as to the substance and the form of the questions put or statements made to a witness

(A) PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCUSSING WITH WITNESS AFTER START AND BEFORE END OF CROSS-EXAMINATION – RULE 12(2)
Rule 12(2) of PCR
- General prohibition: A legal practitioner must not interview or discuss with a witness whom the legal practitioner has called in proceedings before the Court or tribunal at any time after the start and before the end of the cross-examination of that witness about the evidence given or to be given by that witness or any other witness 
- Unless – Permission given by Court: Unless permission given by Court or tribunal 
- In practice, usually court will issue a direction to the witness not to discuss with any person while he is on the stand. So this direction is wider than 12(2) which only applies to when the witness is being CX’d. 

(B) PROHIBITION AGAINST MAKING UNADDRESSED ALLEGATIONS DURING CROSS-EXAMINATION – RULE 12(3)
Rule 12(3) of PCR
- General prohibition: A legal practitioner must not, by asserting in a statement to a Court or tribunal, make any allegation against a witness whom the legal practitioner cross-examined or was given an opportunity to cross-examine
- Unless – Lawyer has given witness an opportunity to answer allegation during cross-examination: Unless legal practitioner has given the witness an opportunity to answer the allegation during cross-examination

(C) PROHIBITION AGAINST SUGGESTING THAT WITNESS OR ANOTHER PERSON IS GUILTY OF OFFENSE – RULE 12(4)

- General prohibition: A legal practitioner must not suggest that a witness or any other person is guilty of any offense or conduct or attribute to a witness or any other person any offense or conduct of which the legal practitioner’s client is accused
- Unless:
* Suggestion relates to a matter in issue that is material to client’s case (e.g. credibility of witness) AND: The suggestion or attribution relates to a matter in issue which is material to the client’s case and 
* Appears to be supported by reasonable grounds: Which appears to the legal practitioner to be supported by reasonable grounds 

Example of permissible accusations: 
- Suggesting that witness is lying to attack credibility of the witness
- Suggesting that witness committed the crime instead of your client 

(D) PROHIBITION AGAINST MAKING STATEMENTS INTENDED TO VILIFY, INSULT OR ANNOY THE WITNESS – RULE 12(5)
Rule 12(5) of PCR
- A legal practitioner must not make any statement or ask any question which is scandalous, is intended or calculated to vilify, insult or annoy a witness or any other person, or is otherwise an abuse of the function of the legal practitioner 

Questions which are indecent or scandalous can be allowed if it is relevant to the facts in issue (LSS v Wong Sin Yee) 
LSS v Wong Sin Yee – Example of inappropriate cross-examination 
- Lawyer was representing a client charged with outraging the modesty of a woman 
- During the course of proceedings when the lawyer was cross-examining the victim, the lawyer:
a. Asked the victim whether she thought she was attractive and suggested that he thought she was 
b. Required the victim to stand up and subject her to physical scrutiny 
c. Said that the victim’s voluptuous top and breast size influenced the client’s desire to molest 
d. When the victim got offended, the lawyer turned around to mount a case that the victim was unattractive and that his client would not have been motivated to outrage her modesty and any contact that took place was accidental 
- Held: 
1. Lawyer’s conduct was grossly improper conduct under s83(2)(b) of LPA and he was suspended for 5 years 
2. Lawyer’s cross-examination did not relate to facts in issue or matters necessary to determine if the facts in issue existed and it was irrelevant 
3. Lawyer’s conduct was cruel and humiliating as he tried to suggest to the victim that she was attractive and physically scrutinized till she was offended only to then suggest that she was so unattractive that her testimony that she was molested could not be believed 
4. Lawyer’s line of questioning was without reasonable grounds and were also scandalous and calculated to insult or annoy 

(E) LAWYER ALLOWED TO INTERVIEW ANY WITNESS (INCLUDING OPPOSING WITNESS) – RULE 12(6) 
Lawyer allowed to interview witness/prospective witness at any stage of proceedings
Rule 12(6) of PCR
- A legal practitioner may interview and take statements from any witness (including a prospective witness) at any stage in the proceedings, whether or not that witness has been interviewed or called as a witness by any other party to the proceedings or by the prosecution (in the case of criminal proceedings)
* Includes witness, prospective witness 
* Includes opposing witness

If Lawyer wants to interview opposing witness who has been called to appear in Court => Lawyer must inform opposing lawyer of Lawyer’s intention to interview opposing witness
Rule 12(7) of PCR

Iskandar bin Rahmat v LSS – No ethical breach by Defense Lawyers who reasonably accepted doctor’s professional assessment that accused could not use defense of diminished responsibility
- Principle: Defense counsel’s role is to take instructions from the accused and consider what defenses, if any, are reasonable and supported by the facts 
- Client alleged that lawyers lacked diligence, failed to follow instructions and failed to advance his case using all legal means and all reasonable defenses as they had failed to advance the defense of diminished responsibility 
- Held: 
1. No ethical breach committed by defense lawyers
a. Client’s instructions to defense lawyers did not reveal facts giving rise to a defense of diminished responsibility 
b. Defense lawyers could reasonably accept doctor’s professional assessment on the matter
c. At each point, the defense lawyers had rendered advice and sought the relevant instructions
d. The exhibits, witnesses and evidence sought by the client were not relevant to his defense

- Legal practitioner must not behave in a manner which is acrimonious or offensive or otherwise inconsistent with his position as a legal practitioner 
- Legal practitioner must not write offensive letters to members of the profession whatever the situation between respective clients 

(A) DUTY OF COURTESY AND FAIRNESS TO OTHER LEGAL PRACTITIONERS – RULE 7(2)
Rule 7(2)
- A legal practitioner must treat other legal practitioners with courtesy and fairness 
(Equivalent of Rule 47 in PCR 2010) 

Case Law Examples – Discourtesy towards other legal practitioners 
LSS v Terence Tan Bian Chye – Lawyer sent threatening and offensive letters to other lawyers
- Lawyer sent letters accusing opposing counsel of deception and of misleading the Court => Lawyer threatened to report the matter to Law Society 
- Lawyer also sent to opposing counsel and other related parties 27 other letters which: 
a. Allege the commission of criminal offenses and 
b. Which contained threats to take criminal proceedings 
c. Which contained statements and questions which were offensive, scandalous or intended or calculated only to vilify or annoy recipients 
- Held: Lawyer found guilty of misconduct under s83(2)(h) of LPA
1. Letter containing threats to report matter to Law Society cannot be said to be treating professional colleagues with courtesy and fairness
2. Letter accusing opposing counsel of contempt of court also lacked courtesy and fairness 

LSS v Ravi s/o Madasamy – Lawyer used abusive language against other lawyer, Lawyer alleged misconduct of another lawyer for ulterior purpose 
- The Respondent was, by order of court, suspended from practice until he submitted to a medical examination. 
a. 1st allegation: The Respondent appeared at the Law Society’s premises with three companions and took an unauthorised video clip of the staff and premises of the Law Society, and published it online, directed vulgarities at the staff and restrained/attempted to restrain the staff from leaving the premises by obstructing the exit.
b. 2nd allegation: The Respondent also sent an email to the Straits Times news desk and a reporter. Email primarily concerned his suspension. Email also contained an allegation that Mr Colin Phan, another advocate and solicitor, had been practising without a practising certificate. 
c. 3rd allegation: The next day, the Respondent made remarks regarding Mr Thio Shen Yi, the President of the Law Society, on the former’s Facebook page.  He posted “… Mr Ravi earnestly feels that Mr Thio Shen Yi needs to go for psychiatric treatment and also it will be helpful if he could ask his sister, the infamous Ms Thio Li-Ann… Thio Shen Yi needs a serious examination of his own head…”.
- Held: A prima facie case for investigation arose and a disciplinary tribunal was ordered to be constituted 
1. On 1st allegation: Use of abusive language and unruly behavior constitutes misconduct unbefitting of advocate and solicitor 
2. On 2nd allegation: Inappropriate for solicitor to allege misconduct of another solicitor for a purpose other than to lodge a formal complaint
3. On 3rd allegation: Respondent was not justified in making remarks against the president and his family 
- Note: Because lawyer was a non-practicing solicitor who has been suspended, leave must be granted by the Chief Justice before an investigation may be conducted (s82A(4) of LPA) 

LSS v K Jayakumar Naidu – Discourtesy to other lawyers but case attracted sanction for failure to advance client’s interests. MAIN TAKEAWAY IS THAT NOT EVERY ACT OF ALLEGED DISCOURTESY BY ONE LAWYER TO ANOTHER WILL COME UNDER SCRUTINY OF THE DUTY OF FAIRNESS AND COURTESY!
- The Respondent felt slighted by another lawyer for having gone behind his back to contact his client. Hence, he failed to respond to the other law firm and intentionally deprived them of the opportunity to object to his course of action or to take steps to stop him.
- Held The Respondent was guilty of misconduct within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) LPA.
1. It was unreasonable for the Respondent to prefer assuaging his “hurt” over his duty to advance his client’s interests. 
2. Such an attitude should not be encouraged even where solicitors are representing different parties in a matter, let alone where they purport to act for the same client. 
3. However, the Respondent’s conduct did not attract sanction under the old r 47 (current r 7(2)) => This is a case of abdication from responsibility and patent disregard of a client’s interests rather than professional discourtesy.
4. Takeaway – not every act of discourtesy from one lawyer to another will be counted as a breach of the duty of fairness and courtesy 

NB: Duty of courtesy to other legal practitioners does not conflict with an adversarial system and duty to act in client’s best interests
China Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd
a. Counsel should advocate persuasively and fearlessly on behalf of their respective clients but this ought to be done within a framework of professional courtesy and common decency 
b. Counsel can disagree and not be disagreeable 

(B) DUTY TO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH CLIENTS REPRESENTED BY OTHER LAWYERS IN RESPECT OF THE SAME MATTER UNLESS CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES – RULE 7(3)

a. Unless prior consent of Lawyer B OR: A has the prior consent (whether express or implied) of B to communicate directly with that person; OR 
b. Unless reasonable basis for communication + Reasonable notification given to Lawyer B, but Lawyer B does not respond within reasonable time; OR: Both of the following apply:
(i) There is a reasonable basis for A to communicate directly with that person 
(ii) Prior to the communication, A has taken reasonable steps to notify B of A’s intention to communicate directly with that person, but B does not respond within a reasonable time after A’s notification; OR 
c. Unless lack of communication will severely prejudice Lawyer A’s client OR: The interests of A’s client will be severely prejudiced if the communication is delayed; OR 
d. Unless lawyer A is authorized by law or Court order to communicate: A is authorized to communicate directly with that person by law or by an order of a court or tribunal

- A replaced lawyer may not communicate with a former client to ascertain the new lawyer’s authority – See PD 8.3.1 
- Extends to officers of a corporate client 

(C) LAWYER MAY GIVE SECOND OPINION OF ANOTHER LAWYER TO CLIENT BUT MUST NOT IMPROPERLY INFLUENCE CLIENT TO TERMINATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OTHER LAWYER – RULE 7(4) 
Rule 7(4) 
- A legal practitioner (A) may give a second opinion to a client of another legal practitioner (B) with or without the knowledge of B
- But A must not improperly seek to influence the client to terminate the relationship between the client and B
Before giving a second opinion, a lawyer must carefully consider whether he is in possession of sufficient facts to give such an opinion – PD 7.3.3 

It is gross discourtesy for a lawyer to comment on the advice given by another lawyer to the other lawyer’s client, even if the other lawyer’s client is his friend. The lawyer may, however, suggest to his friend that he might wish to obtain the other lawyer’s advice on certain aspects of the case – PD 8.5.2 

(D) DUTY TO ENSURE PAYMENT OF APPOINTED LEGAL PRACTITIONER’S FEES – RULE 7(5)

Rule 7(7)
- A legal practitioner (A) must not give an undertaking to another legal practitioner unless
a. A believes that the undertaking is necessary; AND
b. A knows (when giving the undertaking) that A is able to honor the undertaking 
An undertaking by one lawyer to another is a solemn promise on which the latter may rely by making a concession or agreeing to a request or taking (or not taking) a certain step. The former must honor this undertaking in keeping with his duty to act in a professional and responsible manner towards other lawyers.

Practically, a lawyer should NEVER give an undertaking which requires the fulfillment of a condition by a third party or any other condition which is not within his control.

Principle 1: Lawyer cannot cite his client’s instructions as an excuse for not honoring his undertaking 
Otto Ventures Pte Ltd v EEYCT Law LLC
- Solicitor’s undertaking is a PERSONAL undertaking from a solicitor as opposed to an obligation undertaken on behalf of clients 
- Implication: Solicitors cannot cite his client’s instructions as an excuse for not honoring his personal undertaking to another lawyer 
LSS v Arjan Chotrani Bisham – Lawyer failed to honor undertaking given to another lawyer
- Respondent lawyer gave an undertaking to hand over some documents but failed to do so multiple times
- Respondent lawyer also failed to respond to numerous telephone calls and letters made and sent to him 
- Held: Respondent lawyer’s conduct was unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor and he was suspended for 6 months 
1. Respondent lawyer was not dishonest but was untrustworthy 

(G) LAWYER A ENTITLED TO ASK LAWYER B FOR LAWYER B’S AUTHORIZATION TO ACT FOR A PERSON – RULE 7(8)
Rule 7(8) 
- A legal practitioner may ask another legal practitioner (B) whether B has the authority to act for a person 

(H) LAWYER A MUST ACCEPT WRITTEN REPRESENTATION FROM LAWYER B UNLESS THERE IS GOOD REASON NOT TO – RULE 7(9)
Rule 7(9)
- A legal practitioner (A) must accept a written representation by another legal practitioner (B) that B is authorized to act for a person unless A has good reason for suspecting that the representation is false 
- If there are good reasons to doubt the written representation from the other lawyer, one may require that other lawyer to produce his warrant to act. The responsibility to be courteous must be subject to the duty owed to a client to challenge the opposing lawyer’s authority when it is appropriate to do so. In such a situation, there should be no misgivings about offending sensibilities.

Principles underlying requests for opposing counsel to produce Warrant to Act (WTA)
Tung Hui Mannequin Industries v Tenet Insurance Co Ltd 
- Counsel is entitled to request opposing counsel to produce their warrants to act. A lawyer should not view the request to produce his WTA as a request that casts “aspersions on his professionalism and integrity”
- However: 
a. Lawyers are advised to accept representations of authority at face value and not ask to inspect WTA unless there is good reason to: Counsels are advised to accept opposing counsel’s representation as to his authority at face value and should not ask to see their WTA unless there are good reasons to doubt the authority in any particular case
b. One should not ask to see a WTA unless there are good reasons to do so or if circumstances are exceptional
- Requested lawyer should disclose WTA even if Requesting lawyer has an ulterior motive: Opposing counsel who receive a request to disclose his WTA should do so as a matter of course 
a. Even if requesting counsel has an ulterior motive, opposing counsel must still disclose WTA

Requests for written WTA
PD 7.4.3 
- Requests for WTA should not be made unnecessarily: Requests for disclosure of WTA should not be made unnecessarily 
- Requested lawyer can ask for reasons for Requesting lawyer’s suspicion: Lawyer being asked to disclose WTA is entitled to ask the requesting lawyer to provide his reasons for suspecting that the lawyer being asked has falsely represented that he is the client’s lawyer 

(I) UNETHICALITY OF ENTRAPMENT TO OBTAIN EVIDENCE OF ANOTHER LAWYER’S MISCONDUCT 
PD 8.5.5 
- Entrapment to obtain evidence of another lawyer’s misconduct is a breach of Rule 7(2)
a. A legal practitioner (procurer) who obtains evidence of another legal practitioner’s misconduct by entrapment or by illegal or improper means whether directly or indirectly is in breach of Rule 7(2) => Can be liable to disciplinary action under s83 of LPA 
- Should lodge complaint instead: If a legal practitioner becomes aware that another legal practitioner has breached rules of professional conduct, he should lodge a complaint with the Law Society in accordance with established procedures instead of resorting to entrapment or illegal/improper means to obtain evidence 
- Entrapped legal practitioner will also be liable: The legal practitioner who has committed a breach of rules of professional conduct will be equally liable to disciplinary proceedings under s83 of the LPA independent of any wrongful conduct by the procurer 
The procurement of evidence is itself the misconduct.

However, entrapment evidence is admissible as evidence in disciplinary proceedings
Definition of entrapment 
Wong Keng Leong Rayney v LSS
- Entrapment: Luring or instigating the legal practitioner to commit a breach of professional conduct which otherwise, or in ordinary circumstances, he would not have committed in order to prosecute him
a. Agent provocateur who abets the offense by instigation or intentionally aiding the legal practitioner to commit the breach is also himself guilty of unlawful conduct 

Entrapment evidence is admissible as evidence in disciplinary proceedings 
LSS v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis
- Law governing entrapment evidence in criminal proceedings does not apply to disciplinary proceedings 
- Primacy must be given to the legal profession’s ethical and professional code of conduct over any illegal or improper conduct of a member of the profession in procuring evidence to uphold the values of that code 
- Entrapment evidence is thus admissible as evidence 

Case Law Examples – Admissibility of entrapment evidence in disciplinary proceedings 
Wong Keng Leong Rayney v LSS
- An undisclosed law firm employed Tan to investigate whether competing law firms were offering referral fees to estate agents to attract more referrals to illegitimately boost their business 
- Tan engaged complainant to pose as an estate agent for a fictitious prospective purchaser and wanted complainant to probe whether applicant solicitor would fall for the bait 
- The applicant solicitor fell for the bait and the meeting with complainant had been secretly recorded
- Complainant lodged a complaint with Law Society alleging that the applicant had agreed to grant her a referral fee for procuring work for the applicant’s firm
- In Disciplinary Committee proceedings, LSS tendered evidence of audio recordings, transcripts and evidence of entrapment 
- Applicant solicitor argued that the evidence had been wrongly admitted as it was obtained illegally 
- DC dismissed applicant solicitor’s arguments and held that there was no discretion to exclude the evidence => Admitted the evidence 
- Applicant solicitor appealed
- Held: DC was not wrong in admitting the evidence 
1. Even though there was compelling public interest to ensure that investigators did not violate the rule of law by adopting improper methods to procure evidence, there were equally compelling public interest to weed out unethical and malign practices in legal profession => Notwithstanding that there was entrapment, the evidence would still be admitted as evidence against errant lawyers
2. However, Court of Three Judges had profound misgivings in learning that members of legal profession had resorted to ensnaring other practices suspected of touting to avoid unethical competition 

LSS v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis
- Instructing solicitors hired a PI firm to obtain evidence that the respondent firm had been engaging in touting for conveyancing work 
- PI engaged Jenny to run the operation. Jenny telephoned the respondent firm and represented herself as a real estate agent who might want to engage them to act for her client in the purchase of a property 
- Jenny recorded that conversation and also made a video recording of her meeting with the respondent 
- Jenny made a complaint to the Law Society that respondent offered to pay Jenny a referral fee 
- Held: Evidence against respondent can be admitted 
1. Jenny was not the one offering the referral services, respondent was the one offering 
2. Court has no discretion to exclude illegally obtained evidence and entrapment evidence by reason of the provisions of the EA 

LSS v Bay Puay Joo Lillian 
- Jenny was engaged by a PI agency to investigate if certain law firms were touting for conveyancing work 
- Jenny telephoned respondent claiming to be a real estate agent who needed to engage a lawyer 
- Jenny met respondent and asked respondent whether respondent would pay a referral fee for Jenny 
- Respondent agreed
- Held: Respondent was suspended from practice for 9 months 
1. Even though Jenny procured the referral, the respondent succumbed and was also attempting to procure employment for herself 
2. Law did not preclude an attempt to do something which was impossible and the essence of the attempt is the intention to commit the offense => Even though Jenny had no work to refer to the respondent => The respondent was still guilty 

LSS v Liew Boon Kwee James 
- Jenny was engaged by a PI agency to investigate suspected touting by other law firms for conveyancing work 
- Jenny spoke to the respondent law firm’s client services manager to refer conveyancing work to the respondent law firm for a fee 
- Jenny then met the client services manager at the respondent law firm and agreed to instruct the respondent law firm to act in the purchase of a house 
- Held: Respondent was suspended from practice for 12 months 
1. The scale of touting carried out by the Respondent law firm here through the client services manager was more serious than what the lawyer in LSS v Bay Puay Joo Lillian did 
2. The referral fees were actually paid out here 

REPLACED LAWYER MAY NOT COMMUNICATE WITH FORMER CLIENT TO ASCERTAIN NEW LAWYER’S AUTHORITY (WHEN NEW LAWYER CONTACTS REPLACED LAWYER FOR MORE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS) 
When client replaces Lawyer A with Lawyer B => Lawyer B asks Lawyer A for client’s money, property or documents => Lawyer A should not obtain confirmation from client 
PD 8.3.1
- When lawyer A’s former client instructs new legal practitioner to act for him => New legal practitioner asks lawyer A for the former client’s money or property or document => It is not necessary for lawyer A to obtain confirmation from former client 
- Breach of Rule 7 of PCR where lawyer communicates with former client who has engaged a new lawyer even if the communication is only with the view to obtain confirmation of what the new lawyer has written to the lawyer

NO TAKING OVER BRIEF UNTIL RETAINER DETERMINED 
Lawyer A should not act in place of another Lawyer B unless Lawyer B’s retainer has been determined by client
PD 7.3.3
- A legal practitioner should not act in a matter in place of another legal practitioner whom he knows has been retained until that retainer has been determined by the client 

ADVISING A FRIEND WHO IS A CLIENT OF ANOTHER LEGAL PRACTITIONER
Gross discourtesy for Lawyer A to comment on advice tendered by another Lawyer B for Lawyer A’s friend => Lawyer A should only suggest that his friend discuss certain aspects of advice with Lawyer B  
PD 8.5.2
- If a friend of legal practitioner (A) discusses a matter with A and A is not acting for any party in the matter => A is informed that his friend is represented by another legal practitioner (B) => It would be gross discourtesy for A to comment on the advice tendered by B 
- A can suggest to his friend that he might wish to discuss certain aspects of the matter with B to get B to advise him on those aspects of the matter 
=> Rationale: Relationship of mutual confidence and trust which exists between friend and B should not be disturbed 

DRAFT DOCUMENTS 
When lawyers amend draft documents => Amendments should be made on the draft showing original and amendment 
PD 8.5.3 
- For draft documents amended between lawyers: Amendments should be made on the draft clearly showing the original and the amendment

CHALLENGING ANOTHER LEGAL PRACTITIONER ON LAW SOCIETY’S RULINGS 
Lawyers should not challenge other lawyers who act based on Law Soc Rulings => Disputes should be taken up with Law Soc 
PD 2.1.1
- It is not proper for a legal practitioner to challenge another legal practitioner who acts in accordance with a Law Society Ruling simply because the challenging legal practitioner does not agree with the ruling => Challenging legal practitioner should take up the disputed ruling with Law Society and he can write to Law Society without the consent of the other legal practitioner involved 

QUOTING OF REFERENCES IN CORRESPONDENCE
PD 8.3.2
- When writing to one another, lawyers should quote each other’s file reference number 

PHRASING WHEN ACCEPTING SERVICE FOR CLIENT  
PD 8.5.10
Phrasing when accepting service for client
- When legal practitioners write that they have client’s instructions to accept service of originating process => Legal practitioners should state that they “undertake” to accept service and enter an “appearance” instead of the usual form of merely “we have instructions to accept service” 

SERVICE OF COURT DOCUMENTS ON OPPOSING COUNSEL INSTEAD OF OPPOSING PARTY 
PD 8.5.10
Step 1: Assess if the 2 situations below apply
1. Legal practitioner in communication with opposing counsel on the matter: Legal practitioner has been in communication with opposing party’s counsel and such communication is related to the client’s actual or contemplated proceedings; AND 
2. ROC allows service of documents on opposing party or opposing counsel: Rules of Court require legal practitioner to serve the documents on the opposing party personally but also permit service on the opposing party’s counsel as an alternative 

Step 2: Documents should be served on opposing counsel and not opposing party unless
Legal practitioner must serve on opposing party’s counsel and not on opposing party unless:
(i) After asking whether opposing counsel has instructions to accept service AND: The Legal Practitioner has enquired with the opposing party’s counsel whether the latter has instructions to accept service of the Documents on behalf of the opposing party; AND
(ii) Opposing counsel does not confirm: The opposing party’s counsel does not confirm within three working days (excluding a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday) or such other period of time as agreed between the parties that the opposing party’s counsel has instructions to accept service of the Documents on behalf of the opposing party

Step 3: Where documents are served on opposing party, legal practitioner must inform opposing counsel that personal service of documents on opposing party had been effected 
- Where paragraphs B.1(a) and B.1(b) apply, the legal practitioner must inform the opposing party’s counsel in writing that personal service of documents on the opposing party has been effected 
- Notice must be without delay and as soon as possible in the circumstances, having regard to the nature of the act to be done 

Ethical duties in effecting personal service of documents

a. Limit communication with opposing counsel and persons associated with opposing counsel to only communication necessary to effect service; and 
b. Comply with ethical duties under Rule 7 and Rule 8 of PCR 

LETTERS INCLUDING IMPROPER THREATS 
PD 9.1.2 
A lawyer must not write letters that include improper threats. This direction may be treated as applying to communications with other lawyers as well 



(2) Entering default judgement (RULE 28)
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING RULE 28 PCR 
Rule 27(1) of PCR

b. Lawyer is responsible to another lawyer for maintaining due process and promoting administration of justice: A legal practitioner is responsible to an opposing legal practitioner for maintaining due process and promoting the administration of justice 

DUTY TO OBSERVE 2-DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT BEFORE ENTERING DEFAULT JUDGEMENT – RULE 28(1)
Rule 28(1) of PCR
- Lawyer must not enter default judgement against opposing party unless-:A legal practitioner (A) must not enter a default judgment under any provision of Rules of Court against a party who is represented by another legal practitioner (B) unless:
a. Written notice given to opposing counsel: A has given B written notice of A’s intention to enter default judgement; AND 
b. Notice given at least 2 working days before entering default judgement: At least 2 working days have elapsed after notice is given to B
Rationale – ensure that one lawyer does not take unfair advantage of the oversight of another 

Notice given after 4pm or on non-working day is to be treated as given on next working day 
Rule 28(2) 
- Any notice under Rule 28(1) that is given on a working day after 4pm or on a day other than a working day is to be treated as given on the next working day

Definition of working day 
Rule 28(4)
- “Working day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday 

Interaction with deadlines under ROC
Rule 28(3)
- To avoid doubt:
a. This rule does not extend the time stipulated by an order of Court or by any provision of the Rules of Court 2021 for taking any action or step; and 
b. A legal practitioner need not give any notice under Para (1) before taking any action or step on a failure to comply with an order of Court within the time stipulated by the order of Court 

Purpose of Rule 28: Rule of professional courtesy and fairness 
Public Trustee v By Products Traders Pte Ltd 
- General principle: Lawyers should not take unfair advantage of one another
- Rule 28(1) is a rule of professional courtesy and fairness intended to ensure that lawyers do not take unfair advantage of the oversight of another 
- “…an advocate should be fearless in carrying out the interests of his client, but I couple that with this qualification and this restriction, that the arms which he wields are to be the arms of the warrior and not of the assassin. It is his duty to strive to accomplish the interests of his clients per fas and not per nefas”

MISCELLANEOUS ISSUE: NOTICE REQUIREMENT SHOULD APPLY TO JUDGEMENT IN DEFAULT OF APPEARANCE
- The old Rule 70 of PCR 2010 only applied to judgements in default of defense and before setting a divorce petition down as uncontested as an answer has not been filed. It did not apply to judgements in default of appearance as the opposing lawyer had to be “on record” before the old Rule 70 was triggered and if the opposing had not entered an appearance, he would not be “on record” 
- Currently Rule 28 of PCR 2015 omits the phrase “on record” and this could mean that the notice requirement could apply even when entering judgement in default of appearance 
- Suggestion: 2-day notice requirement will apply for entering of judgement in default of appearance where:
a. A has knowledge in correspondence that B is acting for the opposing party; and 
b. B has failed to cause appearance to be entered within the requisite timeline 


(3) Allegations against another legal practitioner (RULE 29) 
LAWYER A MUST NOT MAKE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST LAWYER B IN ANY COURT DOCUMENT UNLESS CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES – RULE 29 
Rule 29
- General prohibition: A legal practitioner (A) must not permit allegations to be made against another legal practitioner (B) in any document filed on behalf of A’s client in any court proceedings 
- Unless:
a. Lawyer B is given opportunity to respond to allegations AND; B is given the opportunity to respond to the allegations; AND
b. Lawyer B’s response is disclosed to Court (if practicable); Where practicable, B’s response is disclosed to the Court 

Imran bin Mohd Arip v PP
- Sending a letter to Lawyer B informing him of the allegations on the same day that the allegations were made known in Court does not discharge Lawyer A’s duty under Rule 29 
- Lawyer A must provide Lawyer B with sufficient particulars of the allegation against Lawyer B to enable Lawyer B to fully respond 

Tan Beng Hui Carolyn
- Lawyer sent an email to opposing counsel alleging that his calls had not been returned. Opposing counsel filed an affidavit to refute the allegation. Lawyer subsequently applied to court with a Request for Further Arguments and alleged that the opposing counsel had lied and perjured himself. Court found that the Lawyer had not given the opposing council the opportunity to respond to the allegations in the Request for Further Arguments. 
- Held: Appeal dismissed. $10,000 penalty remained

Principle 1: Rule 29 does NOT apply where Lawyer B is a party to proceedings, Lawyer B is the victim in a criminal suit, Lawyer B is a non-practicing legal practitioner

Principle 4: Purpose of Rule 29 is to ensure that Court has a balanced picture of allegations made between legal practitioners 
Rationale: 
- Rule 29 ensures that legal practitioners give each other an opportunity to provide the Court a full and balance picture of any allegations made against each other
- Legal practitioners are not parties to the proceedings and would not ordinarily have an opportunity to respond 

Imran bin Mohd Arip v PP
- Rationale behind Rule 29: Ensure that a legal practitioner (A) gives another legal practitioner (B) an opportunity to provide the Court with a “full and balanced picture of the allegation made against B when B, not being a party to the proceedings, would not have had an opportunity to respond” 
- There is a recent trend of accused persons levelling accusations and allegations against previous lawyers in a bid to escape the consequences of their crime => Allegations are now being made through an accused’s newly appointed lawyers in their submissions 

Case Law Example – Breach of Rule 29 
Imran bin Mohd Arip v PP

c. Only one of the three Original Counsel was contacted 
- Held: Lawyer is acting in contravention of Rule 29
