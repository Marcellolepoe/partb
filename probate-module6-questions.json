      "question": "Person P lacks capacity and has no LPA. P's family wants someone to make decisions for P. Under section 20-21 MCA, what should the family do?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The family can collectively make decisions without court involvement.",
        "B": "Apply to court for appointment of a deputy under sections 20-21 MCA.",
        "C": "Create an LPA on P's behalf.",
        "D": "Wait for P to regain capacity."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Court must appoint a deputy. When P lacks capacity and has no LPA, the solution is deputyship. Section 20 MCA gives courts power to appoint deputies. Section 21 specifies who can be deputies and appointment procedures. The family applies to court showing: (1) P lacks capacity (per s 4-5 MCA, with medical evidence), (2) decisions need to be made for P (personal welfare, property/affairs), (3) proposed deputy is suitable (per s 21 criteria). The court assesses and, if satisfied, appoints a deputy with specified powers. Deputyship is REACTIVE (after P loses capacity, no LPA exists) vs LPA which is PROACTIVE (P creates while has capacity, for future incapacity). Deputyship involves court application, hearings, court orders, ongoing supervision - more formal and costly than LPA. But it's necessary when P didn't create LPA and now lacks capacity.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because family cannot make decisions for incapacitated persons without legal authority. The MCA framework provides three mechanisms for decision-making: (1) LPA (if P created one while capable), (2) Deputyship (court appoints deputy), (3) Section 7 (limited to care/treatment by healthcare providers/carers). Family members have no inherent legal authority to make decisions for incapacitated adult relatives. They must either: be appointed as donees (in LPA), be appointed as deputies (by court), or act under s 7 for care/treatment (if they're providing care). Without one of these, collective family decision-making has no legal basis. Third parties (banks, doctors, service providers) wouldn't recognize family authority. The answer incorrectly assumes family authority.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because an LPA must be created by the donor (P) while P has capacity. Section 11(2)(c) MCA requires: 'P is above 21 years old and has capacity to execute.' Once P lacks capacity, P cannot create an LPA. The family cannot create an LPA 'on P's behalf' - that's not how LPAs work. LPAs are the donor's choice of who should act for them. If P lacks capacity and has no LPA, it's too late for LPAs - the solution is deputyship (court appoints someone to act for P). The answer confuses LPA (created by P while capable) with deputyship (appointed by court after incapacity).",
          "D": "This is problematic because waiting might not be viable. Section 6(3) requires considering future capacity - if P will likely regain capacity soon, decisions should wait if possible. But if: (1) P is unlikely to regain capacity (permanent dementia, brain injury), (2) decisions are urgent (P needs medical treatment, care placement, financial management), or (3) waiting would harm P, then waiting is not appropriate. Deputyship allows immediate decision-making for P's welfare. The answer might work if P has temporary incapacity and decisions can wait, but as a general answer, it's insufficient."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Trust corporation or suitable person can be deputy. Section 21(1) MCA allows the court to appoint 'trust corporation or... suitable person.' This is broad - 'suitable person' gives the court discretion. Potential deputies: (1) Family members (spouse, child, sibling) - if suitable (capable, trustworthy, no conflicts), (2) Friends or trusted advisors, (3) Professional deputies (lawyers, accountants, social workers offering deputy services), (4) Trust corporations (institutional deputies for complex estates). The court assesses suitability considering: (1) proposed deputy's relationship with P, (2) ability to perform duties (financial literacy for property deputy, caring nature for welfare deputy), (3) conflicts of interest, (4) P's wishes (if ascertainable), (5) family views. The court prioritizes P's best interests in choosing deputy. Unlike LPA (where donor chooses), in deputyship the court chooses - so 'suitability' is key.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is too narrow. While family members often are appointed (they know P, care about P's welfare, might not charge fees), s 21(1) doesn't limit deputies to family. 'Suitable person' can be non-family. If P has no suitable family (all estranged, incapable, or conflicted), the court might appoint a friend, professional deputy, or trust corporation. The court's primary concern is suitability for the role, not family relationship. The answer incorrectly limits deputies to family.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because lawyers and doctors have no monopoly on deputyship. While they can be appointed (professionals often serve as deputies, especially for complex estates or contentious situations), s 21(1) allows 'suitable person' - anyone suitable, not just professionals. A capable family member (financially literate child, caring spouse) might be more suitable than a professional (cheaper, knows P better, more invested in P's welfare). The court assesses case-by-case. The answer incorrectly limits deputies to specific professions.",
          "D": "This is too broad. While deputies must be 21+ per s 21(2), not everyone over 21 is suitable. Section 21(1) requires a 'suitable person' - suitability is assessed. A 22-year-old with no financial knowledge, estranged from P, with a criminal record, would not be suitable as property deputy. The court must determine suitability considering the factors mentioned. Age 21+ is necessary but not sufficient. The answer treats age as the only criterion."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Consent is required for deputy appointment. Section 24(3) MCA states: 'A person may not be appointed as a deputy without the person's consent --> i.e. deputy cannot be forced by the court to be a deputy.' Being a deputy is a significant responsibility with legal duties and potential liability. The deputy manages P's affairs, makes decisions for P, owes fiduciary duties, must act in P's best interests, and can be held accountable for breaches. The law doesn't force this burden on unwilling persons. The court cannot order 'You are now P's deputy whether you like it or not.' The proposed deputy must affirmatively consent. If the proposed deputy declines, the court must find another suitable person. This might mean: (1) appointing a different family member who consents, (2) appointing a professional deputy (who consents for remuneration), (3) appointing the Public Guardian or official receiver in difficult cases. Consent ensures deputies undertake the role willingly and seriously.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 21(3) prohibits appointment without consent. The court cannot 'compel' anyone to serve. Being a deputy is voluntary. Even if someone is highly suitable (financially literate, caring, knows P well), if they don't consent, they cannot be appointed. Why? Unwilling deputies might: (1) neglect duties (causing harm to P), (2) resign shortly after (disrupting P's care), (3) resent the burden (affecting quality of care), (4) face mental health impact from forced responsibility. Better to have a willing, engaged deputy (even if less 'ideal' on paper) than a compelled, resentful one. The answer incorrectly suggests court compulsion power.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the consent requirement applies to ALL potential deputies, not just non-family. Section 21(3) states 'a person may not be appointed' without consent - 'a person' means anyone (family, friend, professional, corporation). Family members are not subject to compulsory deputyship. A daughter cannot be forced to be her father's deputy if she declines (even if she's the most suitable candidate). The consent requirement is universal. The answer incorrectly creates a family exception.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because unavailability of alternatives doesn't override the consent requirement. If no one consents to be deputy, the court cannot force anyone. The court's options: (1) persuade someone to consent (explain the role, offer professional deputy remuneration per s 24(9), provide support), (2) appoint Public Guardian or official receiver (government-appointed deputies for difficult cases), (3) make specific court orders per s 20(2)(a) instead of appointing deputy (court decides case-by-case rather than delegating to deputy). The answer incorrectly suggests emergency compulsion when no one consents."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Court decision preferred over deputy appointment. Section 20(4) MCA states: 'When deciding whether it is in P's best interests to appoint a deputy, the court must have regard to the principles that: a. A decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy to make a decision. b. The powers conferred on a deputy should be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonable practicable.' Principle (a) means: if the court can make a specific decision for P (under s 20(2)(a) - 'make orders on decisions on P's behalf'), this is preferable to appointing a deputy. Why? Court decisions are more protective - direct judicial oversight for each decision vs delegating to deputy. Court decisions are appropriate when: (1) one-off decisions needed (sell a property, consent to surgery), (2) contentious decisions (family disputes require judicial determination), (3) P might regain capacity soon (no need for ongoing deputy). Deputies are appropriate when: ongoing decisions needed, P's incapacity likely permanent, routine management required (pay bills monthly, arrange care). The principle is: least intervention - only appoint deputy if necessary for ongoing management.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This reverses the preference. Section 20(4)(a) states: 'A decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy.' The court prefers making decisions itself rather than delegating to deputies. Deputies are appointed only when necessary for ongoing management that would be impractical for the court to handle decision-by-decision. The preference hierarchy is: (1) Best - P makes own decision (if has capacity). (2) Second best - Court makes specific decision (if P lacks capacity but only specific decisions needed). (3) Third - Appoint deputy (if ongoing decision-making needed). The answer incorrectly treats deputy appointment as always preferred.",
          "C": "This is not a principle in s 20(4). While the court CAN appoint multiple deputies (s 24(4) - jointly, jointly and severally, or mixed), s 20(4) doesn't express a preference for multiple over single deputies. The principles in s 20(4) are: (a) court decision over deputy, (b) limited deputy powers. Multiple deputies might provide oversight but also create complications (disagreement, coordination difficulties). The court assesses case-by-case. The answer invents a principle not in s 20(4).",
          "D": "This is not a principle in s 20(4). Section 21(1) allows both family and professionals as deputies. The court assesses suitability without automatic preference for professionals or family. Family deputies might be preferred for: (1) knowing P's wishes/values, (2) caring relationship, (3) no fees (s 24(8) - non-professional deputies reimbursed for expenses but no remuneration). Professional deputies might be preferred for: (1) expertise (financial management, conflict resolution), (2) no emotional entanglement, (3) contentious family situations. The choice depends on P's specific needs. The answer invents a professional preference."

Section 24(4) MCA states: '2 or more deputies may be appointed to act: (a) jointly; (b) jointly and severally; or (c) jointly in respect of some matters and jointly and severally in respect of others.' This mirrors s 12(4) for donees. The court has flexibility in structuring multi-deputy arrangements: (1) JOINTLY - deputies must agree on all decisions, provides oversight, prevents unilateral action, but risks deadlock. (2) JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY - deputies can act together or alone, provides flexibility, speeds decisions, but less oversight. (3) MIXED - jointly for major decisions (selling property, major medical treatment), severally for routine matters (paying bills, care arrangements). The court chooses based on: (1) complexity of P's affairs, (2) whether deputies trust each other, (3) need for oversight vs efficiency, (4) geographical separation of deputies. The appointment order specifies how deputies must act. If jointly appointed, one deputy acting alone is invalid (unlike executors who act severally by default).",

          "A": "This is too restrictive. While jointly is one option (s 24(4)(a)), it's not the only option. The court can also appoint jointly and severally (s 24(4)(b)) or mixed (s 24(4)(c)). The choice depends on the case. Jointly is more protective but less flexible. The answer incorrectly limits multi-deputy appointments to joint only.",
          "B": "This is also too restrictive. Jointly and severally is one option (s 24(4)(b)), but not the only one. The court might appoint jointly (if oversight needed) or mixed (if some decisions need agreement, others can be individual). The answer incorrectly limits to jointly and severally only.",

        "correct": "Expenses reimbursed, no remuneration. Section 24(8) MCA states: 'A deputy under subsection (1)(a)(i) or (b)(i) is entitled to be reimbursed out of P's property for the deputy's reasonable expenses in discharging the deputy's functions, but is not entitled to remuneration. --> where deputy is above 21 years' old and provide service without remuneration.' Subsections (1)(a)(i) and (b)(i) refer to individuals serving without remuneration (typically family members or friends). Such deputies are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses (travel, postage, phone calls, document fees) but receive no payment for their time. Example: daughter appointed as mother's deputy spends $200 on accountant fees for mother's tax return - reimbursed. Daughter spends 20 hours managing mother's affairs - no payment for time. This contrasts with professional deputies (s 24(9)) who receive both expense reimbursement AND remuneration for their services (determined by court). The distinction incentivizes family/friend deputies (no cost to P beyond expenses) while allowing professional deputies when needed (for complex cases, contentious families, no suitable non-professional).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is too harsh. While non-professional deputies don't receive remuneration (payment for time), they ARE entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses per s 24(8). If the deputy pays for things from their own pocket (accountant fees, legal fees, document fees, travel to manage P's affairs), P's estate reimburses these costs. Otherwise, deputies would be out-of-pocket, discouraging people from serving. Expense reimbursement is fair - the deputy shouldn't bear financial costs of managing P's affairs. The answer incorrectly denies even expense reimbursement.",
          "C": "This is incorrect for non-professional deputies. Section 24(8) explicitly states: 'is not entitled to remuneration.' Only professional deputies get remuneration per s 24(9): 'A deputy under subsection (1)(a)(ii) or (iii) or (b)(ii) is entitled... to such remuneration, as the court determines, out of P's property.' The distinction is: non-professionals (family/friends) - expenses only, no remuneration; professionals - expenses + remuneration. If a family member wants remuneration, they must qualify as a 'professional deputy' under s 24(1)(a)(ii) or (b)(ii), which requires not being related to P and offering deputy services professionally. The answer incorrectly gives non-professionals remuneration.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there's no 'fixed fee of 5% of P's estate' for deputies. Even professional deputies (who get remuneration) don't have a fixed 5% - the court determines remuneration per s 24(9)(b) considering factors like complexity, time, deputy's skill, P's estate size. Non-professional deputies get no remuneration at all per s 24(8). The 5% figure might confuse this with executor commission (s 66 PAA - up to 5% for executors/administrators), but that's a different context (estate administration vs. ongoing deputyship).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Section 24(5) doesn't expressly prohibit successors to successors.

This allows the court to appoint successors when appointing the primary deputy. But unlike s 12(9) for LPA donees (which explicitly prohibits replacement for replacements), s 24(5) doesn't address whether successors can have successors. The silence suggests the court has discretion - it could appoint: Deputy A, Successor B (if A ceases), Successor C (if B ceases), etc., if the court deems it appropriate. Or the court might limit to one successor layer for simplicity. Given the court's broad discretion under s 24(5) ('may appoint... on such terms'), multiple succession layers might be permissible, unlike the strict LPA limitation.",

          "A": "This is overstating - while s 24(5) doesn't prohibit multiple succession layers, saying 'unlimited' layers are 'allowed' goes too far.

The court would likely limit to reasonable contingency planning (1-2 successor layers). The answer treats discretion as unlimited permission.",

Section 12(9) explicitly states LPAs 'cannot... appoint a person to replace any replacement donee.' Section 24(5) has no such language. This might be deliberate - deputyship is court-supervised (more protective than LPA), so the court can manage more complex succession arrangements. Or it might be an oversight.

Section 24(7) MCA states: 'A deputy is to be treated as P's agent in relation to anything done or decided by the deputy within the scope of the deputy's appointment and in accordance with this Part.' Agency means the deputy acts on P's behalf - the deputy's authorized acts bind P as if P did them. The deputy's acts are attributed to P. Agency principles apply: (1) Deputy must act within scope of appointment (court order specifies powers - can't exceed them). (2) Deputy owes fiduciary duties to P (loyalty, care, must act in P's best interests). (3) Deputy's authorized acts bind P to third parties (contracts made by deputy bind P). (4) Deputy's unauthorized acts don't bind P. The agency characterization clarifies legal relationships - in transactions, the deputy represents P, contracts are in P's name, property remains P's (not deputy's). Deputies are not owners or independent decision-makers but agents executing P's affairs per court authorization and MCA duties.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because 'guardian with parental-like authority' mischaracterizes the relationship. Guardianship (for minors under Guardianship of Infants Act) involves parental-type authority and responsibility. Deputyship is different - P is an adult who lacks capacity, not a child. The deputy is P's agent, not guardian. The relationship is principal-agent, not parent-child. The deputy acts for P within defined powers (per court order), not with broad parental discretion. The answer applies the wrong legal characterization.",
          "C": "This is partially related but not quite right. While deputies might hold or manage P's property, they're characterized as AGENTS (s 24(7)), not trustees. Trustees hold property for beneficiaries under trust law. Deputies manage P's property as P's agents under MCA. The difference matters for legal duties and principles. That said, deputies owe fiduciary duties similar to trustees (loyalty, care, account for property), and trust law principles sometimes apply by analogy. But the statutory characterization is agent, not trustee. The answer uses the wrong legal label.",

These powers are prohibited for deputies - the court cannot confer them, even if the applicant requests. Why are deputies more restricted than donees? Donees are chosen by the donor (who trusts them with gift-making if expressly authorized). Deputies are court-appointed (not chosen by P), so restrictions are stricter. The notes compare: 'Deputy has NO power to dispose and gift... (cf a LPA where it is allowed if explicitly stated).' For donees: gifts allowed if LPA expressly authorizes (s 13(7)) within s 13(8) limits. For deputies: gifts prohibited entirely per s 25(3)(a).

However, the COURT can authorize specific gifts per s 23(1)(b) (court power for 'gift or other disposition of P's property'). The process is: deputy applies to court for order authorizing a specific gift, court assesses best interests and whether gift is appropriate (e.g., customary wedding gift to grandchild), court makes order. The order authorizes that specific gift. The deputy executes per court order. This is different from the deputy having ongoing gift-making power - each gift requires separate court order.

A will is P's direction for post-death estate distribution - profoundly personal. Even if P lacks capacity, a deputy cannot make a will for P. Why? (1) Wills require testamentary capacity - if P lacks capacity, they cannot make a will (no one can make it for them). (2) Deputies might have conflicts of interest (they might be beneficiaries under intestacy, so a will could affect their interests). (3) P's estate should pass per P's existing will (if made when capable) or intestacy - not per deputy's preferences. However, s 23(1)(k) lists 'execution for P of a will' as a COURT power. So the court itself might execute a will for P in extraordinary circumstances (statutory wills in English law, not common in Singapore). But deputies cannot. The restriction is in s 25(3)(d) - deputies absolutely cannot execute wills.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because while executing wills relates to property disposition (property matter), it's specifically prohibited for deputies. Section 23(1) lists court powers re property/affairs including (k) 'the execution for P of a will,' indicating this is theoretically a property power. But s 25(3)(d) prohibits giving this power to deputies. The court might exercise it itself (statutory wills), but cannot delegate to deputy. The distinction is: courts (independent, no conflict of interest) might execute wills in extreme cases; deputies (potential beneficiaries, chosen for other reasons) cannot. The answer ignores the specific prohibition.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 25(3)(d) absolutely prohibits deputy will-execution power - no exception for court-approved contents. The section states: 'NO power to execute a will for P' - full stop. Even if the court pre-approves the will's terms, the deputy cannot execute. If a will is needed, the COURT must execute it per s 23(1)(k), not the deputy. The prohibition protects against deputy conflicts (they might inherit) and preserves testamentary sanctity (wills are so personal that only P or the court can make them, not delegates). The answer invents a court-approval workaround.",

(d) the execution for P of a will' - 'a deputy' means any deputy. While will execution is a property-related matter (disposition of estate), even property deputies cannot be given this power. The prohibition is based on the nature of wills (requiring testamentary capacity, deeply personal) and conflict risks (deputy might benefit), not on the type of deputy appointment.

Why prohibit these? CPF and insurance nominations are quasi-testamentary - they direct who receives CPF monies or insurance proceeds upon P's death. Like wills, they're personal decisions about post-death distribution. The law doesn't let deputies make these on P's behalf. If P made nominations when capable, they stand (unless P revokes, which P can't do if lacking capacity). If P never made nominations, CPF goes to Public Trustee for intestacy distribution (CPF Act s 25A); insurance pays estate.

This is crucial - deputyship respects P's autonomy. Capacity is decision-specific (Re BKR) - P might lack capacity for complex financial decisions but have capacity for simple ones (choosing meals, clothing). The deputy must assess each decision: does P have capacity for THIS? If yes (or if deputy reasonably believes yes), the deputy CANNOT act - P must decide. This requires ongoing assessment. Example: P has dementia (deputy appointed for property). Deputy must decide whether to sell house. Before acting, deputy assesses: does P understand, retain, use/weigh, communicate about this sale? If P does (perhaps P is having a good day, or it's a simple decision P can handle), the deputy cannot make the decision. Only if P lacks capacity for this specific matter can the deputy act.

Prohibiting contact is a serious interference with relationships - both P's relationship with the person and that person's rights. It requires judicial oversight. Deputies might misuse this power (preventing family from visiting P, isolating P, cutting P off from people who disagree with deputy). The court must assess: is prohibition necessary to protect P? Is the person genuinely harmful? Or is the deputy trying to control P's relationships? Only the court makes such determinations.

Deputies might misuse this power (fire good providers who question deputy's decisions, hire compliant providers who rubber-stamp). Judicial oversight is needed.

This establishes hierarchy: donee > deputy. Why? The donee was CHOSEN BY P (while P had capacity) - P's autonomy and choice are respected. The deputy was APPOINTED BY COURT (after P lost capacity) - not P's choice but court's judgment. When P's choice (donee) conflicts with court's choice (deputy), P's choice prevails. Example: LPA donee decides P should not sell house. Court later appoints deputy for property who wants to sell house. Deputy cannot sell - the donee's decision stands. If the deputy believes the donee's decision is wrong, the deputy must apply to court for declaration (s 19) or to have the LPA revoked (s 17) - but cannot unilaterally override. This protects P's choices made while capable.",

If P appointed a donee while capable, that choice is respected. The deputy must work within the donee's decisions. The answer incorrectly prioritizes court appointment over P's choice.",

Example: P created LPA in 2020 (donee appointed). P lost capacity in 2023. Court appointed deputy in 2024. The 2024 deputy cannot override 2020 donee's decisions - the donee's decisions (though from earlier LPA) prevail. The answer incorrectly applies a chronological test.",

The deputy cannot make inconsistent decisions. If the deputy disagrees with the donee, the deputy can apply to court (s 19 declaration on lawfulness, s 17 application to revoke LPA if donee is acting improperly). The court then resolves.

(g) the carrying out or continuation of – (i) life-sustaining treatment on P... or (ii) any other treatment on P which a person providing health care reasonably believes is necessary to prevent a serious deterioration in P's condition.' This prohibits deputies from refusing: (1) life-sustaining treatment (ventilation, resuscitation, dialysis, feeding tubes), (2) treatment preventing serious deterioration (antibiotics for severe infection, surgery for acute condition). These decisions can mean life or death. The law doesn't trust deputies (court-appointed, not P's choice) with such grave decisions. Even if refusal seems in P's best interests (P is terminally ill, suffering, treatment futile), deputies cannot refuse. However, the COURT can make these decisions per s 22(1)(d) (court power to 'give or refuse consent to treatment'). If life-sustaining treatment refusal is appropriate, application must be made to court. Compare donees: they also cannot refuse life-sustaining treatment unless LPA expressly authorizes (s 13(10)). Deputies have no equivalent authorization mechanism - they simply cannot have this power at all per s 25(3)(g).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 25(3)(g) absolutely prohibits this power for deputies, even if in P's best interests. The section states: 'A deputy may not be given powers with respect to...' - categorical prohibition. Best interests doesn't override this. If refusing life-sustaining treatment IS in P's best interests (P is dying, treatment prolongs suffering, P previously expressed wish to refuse), the proper procedure is court application. The court assesses best interests per s 6 and makes the decision per s 22(1)(d). Deputies cannot make this decision even with impeccable best interests reasoning. The answer incorrectly treats best interests as sufficient.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because family consent doesn't authorize deputies to have this power. Section 25(3)(g) prohibits giving this power to deputies - full stop. No exceptions for family consent. Even if all family members agree 'the deputy should be able to refuse life-sustaining treatment,' the court cannot confer this power on the deputy. It violates s 25(3)(g). If the family and deputy agree treatment should be refused, they must apply to court for the court to make this decision per s 22(1)(d). The answer invents a family consent exception.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the prohibition applies to ALL deputies. Section 25(3)(g) doesn't distinguish between personal welfare and property deputies. While life-sustaining treatment is a personal welfare matter, even personal welfare deputies cannot refuse it. This contrasts with most personal welfare powers (deciding where P lives, consenting to routine treatment) which can be delegated to personal welfare deputies. Life-sustaining treatment refusal is so serious that it's court-only, not delegable to any deputy. The answer incorrectly creates a deputy-type distinction."

(2) DISCHARGE the order - revoke the deputyship entirely (if P regains capacity, if deputyship no longer needed, if deputy is unsuitable and no replacement available). Applications for variation/discharge can be made by: P (if has capacity), the deputy, family, Public Guardian, or other interested persons (with court permission per s 38). The court assesses whether variation/discharge is in P's best interests. This ongoing jurisdiction ensures deputyship remains appropriate and responsive to changing circumstances.",

Other grounds: deputy becomes unsuitable, deputy dies, P's needs change (needs more/fewer powers), family situation changes, deputy wants to resign.

And s 25A(2): 'The Public Guardian may register a person as a professional deputy upon being satisfied that the person meets all the prescribed criteria.' Professional deputyship is regulated: (1) Person must apply to Public Guardian for registration. (2) Public Guardian assesses whether person meets prescribed criteria (qualifications, experience, character, financial soundness). (3) If satisfied, Public Guardian registers the person. (4) Registration may be subject to terms and conditions. (5) Public Guardian can cancel registration upon request or prescribed events (misconduct, insolvency, complaints). (6) Aggrieved persons can appeal to Minister. This regulatory framework ensures professional deputies are qualified and accountable. Unregistered persons cannot offer deputy services for remuneration - if they do, they might face penalties. Once registered, the person can be appointed as a professional deputy, receiving remuneration per s 24(9).",

          "A": "This is incorrect because s 25A(1) requires registration with Public Guardian. Not 'anyone can charge fees' - only registered professional deputies can charge. Offering deputy services for remuneration without registration violates s 25A. This protects vulnerable persons (P and family) from unqualified or unscrupulous persons offering deputy services. The registration requirement ensures: qualifications, vetting, ongoing supervision, accountability. The answer incorrectly allows unregulated fee-charging.",

Section 25A regulates offering services (must register with Public Guardian). Once registered as professional deputy, the person can offer services. When someone (family, P before incapacity) wants to use their services, they apply to court for deputy appointment, and the court decides whether to appoint this professional deputy. So: (1) Registration with Public Guardian - prerequisite to offer services. (2) Court appointment - case-by-case for each P.

Example: P's adult child emigrated 30 years ago, had no contact with P since, never visited, never called, never provided support.

The facility: (1) cares for P daily (knows P's condition, needs, behavior), (2) implements care decisions (would work with deputy), (3) might have concerns (about proposed deputy, care plans, payment for care). The 2-working-day deadline ensures the facility is promptly informed. Compare: general relevant persons must be served per Para 49(1) but no specific deadline (just 'should serve').

The court should grant only powers actually needed, for only as long as needed. SCOPE limitation: if P needs property management but retains capacity for personal welfare, appoint deputy for property only (not both). Or if P needs help with investments but can handle day-to-day expenses, limit powers to investments. DURATION limitation: if P might regain capacity in 6 months, appoint deputy for 6 months (reviewable), not indefinitely. Or if P needs one-off decision (sell house), court makes that decision (s 20(2)(a)) rather than appointing deputy.

The answer incorrectly prioritizes deputy convenience over P's rights.",

The deputy applies to court, court assesses whether settlement is in P's best interests, court makes an order settling the trust per s 23(1)(h). The settlement is the court's act, not the deputy's act with approval. The distinction matters - the court exercises its own power, not approves the deputy's power.

Therefore, the court CAN give deputies power to conduct legal proceedings for P. This makes practical sense - if P is involved in litigation (suing for debt, defending claim, contractual dispute), the deputy (as P's agent per s 24(7)) needs authority to conduct the proceedings. The deputy would instruct lawyers, make procedural decisions, authorize settlements, etc., on P's behalf. The deputy acts as litigation representative for P. Without this power, every litigation decision would require separate court orders, paralyzing P's legal rights. Section 23(1)(p) combined with absence of s 25 restriction means this power is delegable.",

While the notes don't detail the test, this power likely mirrors similar provisions in trust and company law (e.g., s 391 Companies Act). The court would consider: (1) Did the deputy act HONESTLY? (no fraud, no self-dealing, genuine attempt to fulfill duty). (2) Did the deputy act REASONABLY? (prudent person standard, appropriate in circumstances, sought advice if needed). (3) OUGHT the deputy FAIRLY be excused? (breach was minor, inadvertent mistake, P suffered no loss, deputy has otherwise performed well).

While deputies might proactively provide reports (good practice), the court can require specific reports at specific times. If deputies chose, they could avoid reporting problems. The mandatory court-directed reporting ensures transparency regardless of deputy preferences. The answer incorrectly makes reporting discretionary for deputies.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 18(3)(a) gives the COURT power to direct reports, and s 24(11)(b) allows the court to require reports to the Public Guardian. Both the court and (via court requirement) the Public Guardian can require reports. The answer incorrectly limits reporting power to the Public Guardian. The court has direct power per s 18(3)(a); the Public Guardian receives reports per s 24(11)(b) when the court so requires."

      "question": "Section 20(4)(a) MCA states 'a decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy to make a decision.' What does this principle mean in practice?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Deputies should never be appointed.",
        "B": "If a specific decision can be made by the court, that is preferred over appointing a deputy to make ongoing decisions; deputies are for situations requiring routine ongoing decision-making.",

        "D": "The principle has no practical effect."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Court decision preferred for specific matters; deputy for ongoing management. Section 20(4)(a) MCA states: 'When deciding whether it is in P's best interests to appoint a deputy, the court must have regard to the principles that... a. A decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy to make a decision.' This means: if the issue is a SPECIFIC ONE-OFF DECISION (sell this house, consent to this surgery, resolve this dispute), the court should decide it itself (per s 20(2)(a)) rather than appoint a deputy. But if the issue requires ONGOING ROUTINE DECISIONS (pay bills monthly, manage investments, arrange day-to-day care), appointing a deputy (per s 20(2)(b)) is appropriate - the court can't make dozens of small decisions continuously. Example: P needs to sell house to fund care (one-off decision) and needs ongoing care management (routine decisions). Court should: (1) decide the house sale itself (specific decision preferred per s 20(4)(a)), (2) appoint deputy for care management (ongoing decisions impractical for court). The principle promotes least restrictive intervention - use deputy only when court decisions are impractical.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 20(4)(a) creates a preference, not an absolute rule. Deputies should be appointed when ongoing routine decision-making is needed (court decisions impractical). The principle is: prefer court decisions where viable, use deputy when necessary. If P needs continuous management (pay bills, investments, care coordination), deputy appointment is appropriate despite the s 20(4)(a) preference. The answer incorrectly treats the preference as an absolute prohibition.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the principle is about WHEN to appoint deputies (prefer court decision for specific matters), not about the quality of court vs deputy decisions. Once a deputy is properly appointed with appropriate powers, the deputy's decisions (made per MCA principles and in P's best interests) are legally valid. They're not 'inferior' to court decisions. The principle is procedural (which mechanism to use) not qualitative (whose decisions are better). The answer misunderstands the principle.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 20(4)(a) has significant practical effect. It guides courts: when applications seek both specific decisions and deputy appointment, make the specific decisions yourself (s 20(2)(a)) and only appoint deputy for ongoing matters (s 20(2)(b)). It promotes minimalist intervention - don't appoint deputy if court can resolve the issue. Courts regularly apply this principle, making specific orders and appointing deputies only for residual ongoing needs. The answer incorrectly dismisses the principle as meaningless."
