Introduction to wills and wills drafting
- When you draft a will for a client, make sure:
o You know what the client wants to do
o That what the client wants can be done
o That the client knows what he wants to do
o That you write for the client in the will says what the client wants to do
o That if there is a timeline for the will to be prepared and executed, that it is done on time
- What is a will?
o A will is a declaration in writing, made in accordance with the formalities required by Statute, of the intention of the person making it with regard to matters which he/she wishes to take effect upon or after his/her death. (Section 23 Forms & Precedents (4th Edition), 495)
- Who can make a will?
o Testator (the person making the will)
* Has to be at least 21 years old
* (Section 4, Wills Act)
* The exception are soldiers and mariners (section 26, Wills Act)
* Has to be of sound mind
* Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline [2010] 4 SLR 373
o Testatrix bequeathed her residuary estate in an earlier will to the respondent, then later sold a half-share in one of her properties to the respondent and the respondent’s husband. This caused the appellant other daughter to be unhappy. The testatrix then was preliminarily diagnosed to be suffering an early onset of dementia and loss of memory. Despite this, the appellant instructed a lawyer to draft another will benefitting her. The trial judge held that this second will was invalid because of medical opinion that the testatrix lacked the requisite testamentary capacity to execute the will, and that the testatrix did not know and approve of the contents of the will.
o The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeal, holding that under ordinary circumstances the reading of a will to a testator not suffering any mental infirmity would be sufficient evidence of his understanding or knowledge of the contents, but that general principle would not apply to a situation where the testator might not have full understanding due to the onset of dementia.
o At [60], the Court of Appeal noted that if a testator was known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she was allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator fully understood the will. Furthermore, the solicitor should ask the appropriate questions to ascertain the testator’s capacity to understand the contents of the will. The testator should be asked as simple a question as whether he or she was making a will for the first time or whether he or she had made a will. In the latter case, the solicitor should ask whether the testator knew he was revoking the existing will. These questions might be formulaic, but they were necessary to avoid cases of the nature that we had decided. Finally, as a matter of good professional practice, if not professional prudence, the solicitor should make a contemporary written record of his or her attendances on the testator so that he or she would be able to recall exactly what had transpired during the meeting or meetings.
* George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George [2009] SGHC 79, applying Banks v Goodfellow [1870] LR 5 QB 549
o George had schizophrenia, and executed a will drafted by his father, leaving his entire estate to his nephew and two nieces. His younger brother lodged a caveat against the grant of probate, challenging the validity of the will on his lack of testamentary capacity, lack of knowledge of or absence of approval of the contents of the will and undue influence in the execution of the will.
o The judge at first instance held that the appellant’s father failed to prove that George had testamentary capacity.
o The High Court allowed the appeal, endorsing Banks v Goodfellow at [29] and holding the legal requisites as:
* the testator understood the nature of the act and what its consequences were;
* he knew the extent of his property of which he was disposing, 
* he knew who his beneficiaries were and could appreciate their claims to his property;
* he was free from an abnormal state of mind that might distort feelings of judgments relevant to making the will
o Mohamed Ismail Bin Ibrahim v Mohd Taha Bin Ibrahim [2004] 4 SLR(R) 756
* A principal restriction in Muslim law, as had been declared in all the authoritative works and treatises, and referred to in s 114 of the AMLA, was that a testator was not entitled to dispose of more than one-third of the property belonging to him at the time of death, and that the residue of his property must descend in fixed proportions to his legal heirs unless consent was given by all legal heirs to any deviation from the rule.
- When is a will valid?
o When it complies with both formal and substantive requirements:
* Formal validity (Section 5, Wills Act)
* In writing (Section 6, Wills Act)
* Executed in the presence of 2 or more witnesses at the same time and those witnesses shall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator (Section 6(2), Wills Act)
* The beneficiaries or spouse of a beneficiary cannot be witness(es) to the will (Section 10, Wills Act)
- When does a will take effect?
o Every will shall be construed with reference to the real and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of a testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will (section 19 Wills Act) i.e upon the death of a testator
* This is known as the ‘ambulatory’ nature of a will
* A will can be changed as often as the testator wants during his or her lifetime, as long as he or she has the testamentary capacity to do so
- Construction of wills
o Overriding aim of court in construction of wills
* Foo Jee Seng v Foo Jhee Tuang [2012] 4 SLR 339
* The overriding aim in construing a will was to give effect to the testator’s intention, which had to be derived from the wording of the will. Although a trustee of a trust for sale was accorded the power to postpone sale as he thought fit, such a power had to still be exercised reasonably. Whether a court should intervene in the decision of the trustee was fact-sensitive and would ultimately be dictated by the demands of justice of the case.
* While the testator had every right to determine how his assets were to be managed through his will, the trustees’ duty to exercise discretion under the will also had to be exercised properly. This duty would be subject to the court’s purview, and was not only limited to instances where there had been bad faith on the trustee’s part.
* Zhao Hui Fang v Commissioner of Stamp Duties [2017] 4 SLR 945 at [46]–[54]
* The issue of whether Mdm Zhao had a proprietary life interest or personal licence to reside turned on the Testator’s intention. This had to predominantly be derived from the wording of the Will itself, although the circumstances prevailing at the time of execution of the Will could also be taken into account.
o Admission of relevant extrinsic evidence in ascertaining testamentary intention
* Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR (R) 1079
* If the testator’s expressed intention was ambiguous on the face of the will, relevant extrinsic evidence might be admitted as an aid to construction. Such evidence was not admissible for the purpose of altering the will but to enable the court to understand it.
* In the light of the patent ambiguities in the Will, this was a case where the Testator’s expressed intention was not clear on the face of the Will. It was thus appropriate for the court to review all relevant admissible extrinsic evidence for the purposes of construing the Testator’s intention as manifested by the words used in the Will.
o Relevance of evidence from lawyer assisting in drafting and execution of the will
* Lau Tyng Tyng v Lau Boon Wee [2014] 3 SLR 1014 (precatory wording in wills)
* Testator stated in a clause that it was his “wish and strong desire” that the beneficiaries not part with or dispose of the said shares and that his children “work together” to “continue to grow the business” of the company; otherwise, he would “entrust the business” to the applicant.
* In appropriate circumstances, the court might admit relevant extrinsic evidence in ascertaining the testator’s intention as expressed in the will. The evidence from the lawyer who assisted in the drafting and execution of the will would have been highly relevant here.
* It was extremely unlikely that the testator had intended by the word “entrust” to create an actual trust when the shares in the Company had already been gifted to the beneficiaries absolutely under cl 3 and the “business” was actually owned by the subsidiaries of the Company. Such a trust would contradict cl 3. As cl 3 was unambiguous, cl 4 ought to be construed in a manner that was harmonious with cl 3.
* Even if the testator had intended cl 4 as a condition subsequent to the gift of shares in cl 3, it would nevertheless be invalid or unenforceable at law for being void as a restraint upon alienation. There was no reason why the rule against restraints on alienation, which typically applied to real property, should not also apply to personalty. Furthermore, cl 4 was too conceptually uncertain to be valid.
o Construction of gifts under wills (Sections 21, 24, 25 and 26 WA)
* Section 21: real estate of the testator described in a general manner shall be construed to include any real estate that the testator has power to appoint over in any manner he thinks proper.
* Section 24: real estate of the testator passing to the trustee/executor shall be construed to pass the entirety of the estate/interest unless a definite term of years, absolute or determinable shall thereby be given expressly or by implication.
* Section 25: real estate of the testator passing to the trustee for trusts for purposes shall be construed to pass the entirety of the estate/interest unless a definite term of years, absolute or determinable shall thereby be given expressly or by implication
* Section 26: if any beneficiaries from a will die, but leave children behind, the testator’s gift (real estate) will not lapse but take effect as if the death of that beneficiary had happened immediately after the death of the testator
o Subsequent conveyance does not prevent operation of the will (Section 18 WA)
o Ambulatory nature of wills (Section 19 WA)
* Every will to be construed with reference to the real estate and personal estate comprised in it as if it was executed immediately before the death of the testator.
o When beneficiaries predecease the testator (Sections 20, 23 and 26 WA)
* Special rule that applies if the beneficiary who predeceases the testator is one of the testator’s children (Section 26 WA)
* Re Will of Loke Soh Lui [1997] 3 SLR (R) 956
* Whether section 26 of the Wills Act operates depends on how the children are described in the will
* Section 26 of the Wills Act operates where the children are named; if the name child passes before the testator, his/her share is reverted back to the testator’s estate for distribution.
* If the testator wishes for the failed gift to pass to someone else other than to the named deceased child’s estate, an express clause in the will must indicate this contrary intention.
* Note that this does not apply to a class gift
* WDS v WDT [2022] SGHCF 12
* Equity will not assist a volunteer. While it was clear that the deceased wanted to make the gift, her intention alone is insufficient, and that intention must have been acted on by the donor, taking all the necessary steps within her power to effect that gift.
* Note the importance of a gift-over provision (provision by which a “substitute” beneficiary can “take over” the gift to the original beneficiary)
o Ademption (Low Gim Har v Low Gim Siah [1992] 1 SLR(R) 970 at [57]–[59])
* Ademption of a specific gift would occur:
* (a) when the subject matter of the gift was disposed of or destroyed before the will took effect; 
* (b) when it ceased to conform to the description by which it was given; or 
* (c) when the nature of the gift changed its character. 
* Whether there was ademption in any particular case was a question of construction. The present case did not fall within any of the established categories of cases where the courts have held that ademption had occurred. At the date of LYK’s death, the shares remained the same as before and ademption had not taken place
o Abatement (where the assets are insufficient to fulfil all the debts, expenses, and gifts in full)
o Validity of Donatio Mortis Causa – whether precluded by the WA
* Koh Cheong Heng v Ho Yee Fong [2011] 3 SLR 125
* Three requirements in law [13]:
o A gift must have been made in contemplation of impending death
o The gift must have been made upon the condition that it is to be absolute and complete only on the donor’s death. The condition need not be express and will normally be implied from the fact that the gift was made when the donor was ill.
o There must have been delivery of the subject matter of the gift, or of something representing it, which the donee accepts. When the donor delivers the property, he must intend to part with dominion over it, rather than with mere physical possession.
- Taking instructions to prepare a will
o Domicile of testator
o Testamentary capacity of the testator
o Declaration of testamentary intention
o Revocation of prior wills and codicils
o Appointment(s) of executor(s), trustee(s), and guardian(s)
o Disposition of property: legacies (specific and general) and devises, and gift-overs (Note any particular system of law which may apply to the property, e.g., immovable property in a foreign country)
o Residuary clauses (Ensure that there is no partial intestacy arising under the will, and what happens where there is partial intestacy – see below on the Intestate Succession Act 1967 (“ISA”))
o Powers and directions to executors and trustees; implied powers of trustees in the Trustees Act 1967 (“TA”) and Section 35(1) CLPA
o Testimonium clause
o Attestation clauses variations (where testator is unable to sign, or cannot understand English, or signs with a non-English language, or is blind)
- Typical clauses in a will
o Start
* Commencement
* Revocation
* Appointment of executor(s) and trustee(s)
* Appointment of guardian(s)
o Main Body
* Specific gift(s)
* Residuary gift(s)
o End of Will
* Testimonium
* Attestation
- Start
o Commencement of a will
* E.g. “This is the last will and testament of (NAME) (NRIC number) of (ADDRESS).”
o Revocation clause (section 13 Wills Act and section 15 Wills Act)
* E.g. “I revoke all former wills, codicils and other testamentary dispositions made by me.”
* Codicil means an additional document that is meant to be attached to your will, containing changes to your will.
o Appointment of executor and trustee
* Anyone who is an adult, including beneficiaries of the will, can be appointed as the executor and trustee.
* While any number of persons can be named in a will, probate can only be granted to 4 persons (section 6 of Probate and Administration Act)
* Substitutional appointment of executor and trustee is advisable especially if there is only one named executor/trustee as there is a risk that he might pre-decease the testator or choose to renounce his office
* E.g. “I appoint my grandfather Tan Ah Kow of 1 Chancery Lane, Singapore 200200 to be the sole executor and trustee of this my Will but if my said grandfather shall die in my lifetime or shall refuse or be unable to act as such executor and trustee then I appoint my niece Louise Lim of 200 Lotus Avenue, Singapore 100100 to be the executor and trustee of this my Will.”
o Appointment of guardians, if applicable
* A testator can appoint testamentary guardians under the will. These need not be biologically related to the child – cf. natural guardian (section 7 of the Guardianship of Infants Act)
- Main Body
o Specific gift clauses
* Specific gift clauses. A specific gift is a gift of a particular item(s) or any asset including land and other types of immovable property. It must be described accurately.
* E.g. “I give $100,00.00 free of interest to my friend Andrew Chia provided he survives me”.
* E.g. “I give my property known as 12 Maple Hill, #05 01, Singapore to my son, Robert Tan.”
o Non-specific gift clauses
* There is no indication of any specific shares or specific items to be gifted.
* E.g. “I give to my daughter Alice Ang, 1000 shares in Capital Growth Limited.”
* “I give all my personal possessions to Lim Peck Tong.”
o Distinguish between a gift of residue (residuary gift) and a gift of something other than residue (non-residuary gift)
* E.g. Martin Fernandez gives S$200,000.00 free of interest to each of his 4 children.  He gives all his watches to his nephew Alan Chan.  Everything else he leaves to his wife.  The gift of money and watches are (specific) non-residuary gifts and the gift of everything else is a gift of residue.
o Residuary gift clauses
* To trustees on trust for sale, to be held for a beneficiary with provision for survivorship/gift over
* E.g. 2 “I give the residue of my estate out of which shall be paid my debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and estate duties if any, to my trustees on trust for sale with power to postpone sale without liability for loss and such estate and the property which currently represents it is referred to in this will as “my Residuary Trust Fund”. My trustees shall hold my Residuary Trust Fund for Wilson Boh but if Wilson Boh shall predecease me then to Wilson Boh’s children in equal shares.”
* In the above example a trust is needed because minor interests (being Wilson’s children as the alternate beneficiaries/gift over beneficiaries) may arise if the primary beneficiary (Wilson) dies before the testator.
* All the property that the testator has not given away by his will is the testator’s residuary estate.
* The residuary estate is usually used to pay debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, estate taxes and legacies.
* Immediate gift of residuary estate to a class of beneficiaries
- The End
o Testimonium clause
* A clause at the end of the will
* E.g. “In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of July 2020.”
o Attestation clause (section 6 of Wills Act)
* General attestation clause
* E.g. “Signed by the abovenamed Tan Ah Moi as her last will and testament in the presence of us both present at the same time who at her request and in the presence of each other have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses:-”
* Where translation of the Will is required
* E.g. “Signed by the above named [name of testator] in our presence and by us in his, the testator being unbale to understand English but understanding Mandarin the will was translated into Mandarin by [name of translator] who is fully conversant with Mandarin and English before execution as stated above when the testator appeared thoroughly to understand and have knowledge of the will.”
- How to refer to people in wills
o Naming the testator
* If the testator is known by another name e.g. Lee Li Chua -also known as Karen L.L. Chua –then in the commencement of the will, the other name(s) ought to be included, especially if the testator owns assets in that other name(s).  This is so when the Grant of Probate is issued on the will proved, it would then bear all the names of the deceased and the assets held in the other name(s) can be dealt with by the executors/trustees.
o Details of beneficiaries and witnesses
* The full names/IC numbers of beneficiaries and witnesses and their respective addresses should be set out in the Will so that it is easier to locate them in the future when necessary
* The Court may require an affidavit from a witness if it is not satisfied with the execution of the Will (refer to Rule 215 FJR)
- Family Justice Rules 2014
o Rule 211: Where a will contains no attestation clause or the attestation clause is insufficient or where it appears to the Registrar that there is some doubt about the due execution of the will, he shall, before admitting it to proof, require an affidavit as to due execution —
* (a)	from one or more of the attesting witnesses; or
* (b)	if no attesting witness is conveniently available, from any other person who was present at the time the will was executed.
(2)  If no affidavit can be obtained in accordance with paragraph (1), the Registrar may, if he thinks fit having regard to the desirability of protecting the interest of any person who may be prejudiced by the will, accept evidence on affidavit from any person the Registrar may think fit to show that the signature on the will is in the handwriting of the deceased, or of any other matter which may raise a presumption in favour of the execution of the will.
(3)  The Registrar, after considering the evidence —
* a)	must, if he is satisfied that the will was not duly executed, refuse probate and order accordingly; or
* (b)	may, if he is doubtful whether the will was duly executed, refer the matter to the Court.
o Rule 215: (1) The Registrar may require an affidavit from any person he may think fit for the purpose of satisfying himself as to any of the matters referred to in rules 212, 213 and 214.
(2)  Where an affidavit referred to in paragraph (1) is sworn by an attesting witness or other person present at the time of the execution of a will the deponent must depose to the manner in which the will was executed.
- Properties that cannot be disposed of in a will/gifts that fail
o CPF savings
* Must be distributed by way of a CPF nomination (section 25 of CPF Act)
* At least 16 years of age through “a memorandum”; can nominate one or more persons
* Marriage revokes CPF nominations
* If no nomination, Board must pay all the moneys payable on the member’s death out of the Fund to the Public Trustee for disposal in accordance with the Intestate Succession Act 1967 for non-Muslims, or section 112 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act 1966 for Muslims
* Chai Choon Yong v CPF Board [2004] 2 SLR(R) 416
* Wang made Lai the sole beneficiary under her will, and after her death, Lai was granted probate of Wang’s will. Wang’s mother sought to declare the nomination null and void on the ground that Wang’s signature had not been witnessed in the presence of two witnesses and that the witnesses did not sign the nomination form in each other’s presence. The plaintiff argued that since the nomination was invalid, the money should be paid to the Public Trustee for disposal in accordance with the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146) (“the ISA”), under which she should be entitled to a distribution of the money. The CPF Board (“the Board”) maintained that there was a subsisting nomination at the time of Wang’s death and that it was obliged to pay the money to Lai as nominee.
* The CPF Act restricted a testator’s freedom of testamentary disposition where CPF money was concerned. This restriction could not be avoided by a promise to make certain dispositions of the money. Moreover, a testator could only make a testamentary disposition of assets which he possessed at the time of his death. These assets did not include CPF money.
* The rule requiring two witnesses for the nomination form was merely a procedural requirement intended for the Board’s benefit. The Board could waive the rule on the facts since there was no doubt as to Wang’s intention to nominate Lai. Since there was sufficient substantial compliance with the requirements of the rule, there was a valid and subsisting nomination in favour of Lai.
* Saniah bte Ali & Others v Abdullah bin Ali [1990] 3 MLJ 135
* The deceased had, during his lifetime, nominated only the first plaintiff, who was the deceased`s stepsister, to receive in her own right the entire amount payable on his death out of the Central Provident Fund (the Fund). On the deceased dying intestate, the CPF paid out the deceased`s moneys to the first plaintiff. Under Muslim law, the defendant, who was the deceased`s brother, was entitled to the whole estate of the deceased. The issue that arose was whether the first plaintiff was entitled to retain the entire amount of the deceased`s CPF moneys. It was argued that by virtue of s 112(1) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AML Act), the estate of any Muslim dying intestate was to be distributed in accordance with Muslim law.
* The general scheme of the CPF Act was to treat a member`s moneys in the Fund as a species of property separate and distinct from his other property. It was not subject to any attachment, sequestration, etc. On his death, it did not form part of his estate.
o Proceeds from insurance policies
* Section 73 of Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (CLPA)
* Presumed trust over proceeds created in favour of spouse and children
* Section 131, 132 and 133 of the Insurance Act
* Trust nomination and revocable nomination are not valid unless it provides for the disposition of all policy moneys under the relevant policy; policy moneys from trust nomination does not form part of the estate of the policy owner and are not subject to his or her debts.
* Trustees have to be >18 years old
* Section 150(2) of the Insurance Act read with the Insurance (General Provisions) Regulations 2003 – Insurance companies can pay up to $150,000 without grant of probate or letters of administration
o Property held in joint tenancy
* Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108
* The presumption of advancement would operate only where there was no direct evidence that might reveal the actual intention of the parties; only then would there be any necessity to infer or presume intention. The presumption of advancement was still very relevant in the established (both traditional and extended) categories of relationships; it was the strength of the presumption that should vary with the circumstances in accordance with modern social conditions.
* Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v Fatimah bte Abud bin Talib [2010] 2 SLR 1123 
* The Property was registered land subject to the LTA. Section 114 of the LTA made no reference to the transmission of land held in joint tenancy upon the death of a joint tenant since there was no transmission in law. The interest of a deceased joint tenant extinguished or disappeared into thin air. Hence, legally, no interest in the Property passed to the 1st Respondent upon the Deceased’s death. Whatever interest the Deceased had in the Property simply ceased to exist, and the 1st Respondent became the sole absolute owner because she would no longer be subject to the right of survivorship.
* The legal result of the right of survivorship under s114 of the LTA could not be modified to suit the circumstances of Muslims. If the right of survivorship in a joint tenancy of registered land was contrary to Muslim law, then the statute had to prevail over personal law because that had to have been the legislative intent. Where legislation was enacted to deal specifically with a subject matter, there was no room for modification to suit local circumstances pursuant to the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed) in the absence of an express direction to the contrary. Section 112 of the AMLA therefore did not apply to the determination of rights and interests in land in Singapore and the Property did not form part of the “estate and effect” of the Deceased under s 112 of the AMLA.
* Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun [2014] SGCA 36 
* X acquires a beneficial interest in a property by way of a common intention constructive trust when he relies to his detriment on a common intention that the beneficial interest in the property is to be shared. Such a common intention may: (a) arise from an express discussion; or (b) take the form of an inferred common intention, as evidenced by direct financial contributions by X to the purchase price of the property; or (c) in exceptional situations, arise from other conduct by X which gives rise to an implied common intention.
* Ong Chai Soon v Ong Chai Koon [2022] 2 SLR 457 (CA) at [34]–[35]
* Instead, the court is ultimately concerned with identifying whether the parties shared a common intention as to the beneficial interest in the property. Although direct financial contributions to the purchase price of that property are an important consideration, they are not the only basis upon which the court may infer such a common intention.
* Note that a will cannot sever a joint tenancy; this can only be severed by a way of notice of severance and serving a copy on the other joint tenant (section 35 and 66A of the CLPA; section 53(5) of the Land Titles Act)
o Considerations for certain types of immovable property
* Sections 2, 3, 4 and 25(5) of the Residential Property Act 1976
* Prohibitions on transfer to, or purchase or acquisition by, foreign persons of residential property
o No estate or interest in any residential property belonging to a deceased person who dies on or after 11 September 1973 passes by bequest, succession or inheritance to any foreign person who is beneficially entitled under a will or under any written law governing intestate succession.
o Condominiums and apartments are exempted
* Without limiting the powers of the Minister under subsection (4), the Minister may, in his or her discretion, grant approval, with or without conditions, to any applicant, being a natural person, who intends to purchase or acquire residential property for the purpose of the applicant’s own occupation and that of the applicant’s family as a dwelling house and not for the purpose of rental or any other purpose; and for the purposes of this subsection “an applicant” means one —
o (a)	who is a permanent resident;
o (b)	who, in the Minister’s opinion, is of economic benefit to Singapore or who, in the Minister’s opinion, makes or is able to make an adequate economic contribution to Singapore; or
o (c)	who, not being a citizen, possesses professional or other qualifications or experience which, in the Minister’s opinion, are of value or of benefit or advantageous to Singapore.
* Sections 50, 58 and 59 of the Housing and Development Act 1959
* If you/your spouse/your occupier owns a HDB, you are not entitled to purchase a HDB.
* If you own a property, you have to wait for 30 months after selling the property before applying to buy a new HDB.
* Property not to be used as security or attached, etc., and no trust in respect thereof to be created without approval of Board
* Transfer of HDB flat upon death of owner must not be registered under the provisions of the Registration of Deeds Act 1988 or the Land Titles Act 1993 without the written consent of the Board.
* Property subject to mortgages (Section 26 Civil Law Act 1909)
o Joint bank accounts
* Low Gim Siah v Low Geok Khim [2007] 1 SLR(R) 795 at [9]–[10], [52]–[53] 
* As the presumption of advancement was premised on the moral or equitable obligation of one party to support or make provision for another rather than the existence of financial dependence, it was prima facie applicable to the six accounts by virtue of the relationship between LKT and LGB.
* The proper principle to apply in relation to rebutting the presumption of advancement was that the more readily the presumption may be inferred from the relationship, the greater was the evidence needed to rebut it and, conversely, the less readily the presumption was inferable, the lesser was the evidence needed to rebut it.
* As LKT had full and complete dominion over the money in the six joint accounts throughout his life, the presumption that LKT intended for LGB to have the money in the joint accounts upon his death was rebutted.
* Bank documents could be strong evidence of a party’s intention at the time the parties signed them, but that they should not be assigned presumptive value when trying to determine a party’s intention. The probative value of such documents, like any other relevant evidence, could only be ascertained after an assessment of the totality of the relevant evidence and, as the case demonstrated, these documents did not always provide accurate evidence of the parties’ intent.

* In particular, in the case of bank accounts held and operated jointly by persons in the established categories of relationships, there will be a strong inference that the rule of survivorship is intended to apply. This may be reinforced, if there exist bank documents which prescribe and declare the operation of survivorship in relation to the joint account; such documents could constitute cogent evidence of the parties’ intention that the absolute benefit of the account should devolve to the surviving joint account-holder. Nevertheless, this needs to be assessed in relation to the factual matrix.
* Lim Chen Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin Peng [2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 
* Where there was clear evidence of intention of the deceased, there should be no need to apply any presumption of a resulting trust. Only when the court was not able to find any clear intention or if the evidence was inconclusive either way as to what the deceased’s real intention might be, should the court apply the evidential presumption of a resulting trust in favour of the estate of the deceased (who solely contributed the moneys in the joint account).
* In satisfying the burden of proof, bank documents might have strong evidential value but they did not have legal presumptive value. On a balance of probability, Bee Bee had intended to give the moneys in the joint account to the defendant. There was no need to apply any legal presumption of a resulting trust to help resolve the question of Bee Bee’s intention. The moneys in the joint account belonged both legally and beneficially to the defendant.
* Estate of Yang Chun (Mrs) nee Sun Hui Min, deceased v Yang Chia-Yin [2019] 5 SLR 593 
* The operation of the right of survivorship turned on several successive stages of analysis. A court had to consider if there was a presumption of resulting trust, displacing survivorship, and the strength of that presumption. It then had to determine if the presumption of advancement was applicable, its strength based on the nature and state of the parties’ relationship. Lastly, on the weight of the evidence, did the presumption of advancement rebut a presumption of resulting trust such that the right of survivorship took effect.
* The principles of survivorship were applicable to joint bank accounts.
* Chye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong (executor and trustee of the estate of Chye You, deceased) [2021] 5 SLR 608 (HC); Chye Seng Kait v Chye Seng Fong (executor and trustee of the estate of Chye You, deceased) [2021] 2 SLR 1131 (CA) 
* While it was true that an executor’s duty to call in the assets of the estate was a fiduciary duty, this was a duty owed as executor, not as trustee. Breach of this duty was therefore strictly speaking, not a breach of trust because the executor had yet to assume the role of trustee of those assets. However, even though breach of this duty was not a breach of trust, an executor could be liable to account on the wilful default basis where his breach was a devastavit causing loss.
* The construction of cl 2 of the Will. In construing a will, the court sought to ascertain and give effect to the testator’s intention as expressed in his will, read as a whole in light of any admissible extrinsic evidence. On a proper construction of cl 2 of the Will, the father made an absolute gift of the CMJ Joint Accounts to CMJ. First, the father declared to whom the jointly owned properties “shall” belong. This imperative language showed that the father’s intent was actively to make a gift, not passively to state that he was content with the legal position which would obtain in any event when a right of survivorship operated by law. Second, to construe cl 2 as merely reiterating the legal position that would obtain when a right of survivorship operated by law would render cl 2 entirely superfluous. In construing a will, the court would seek to give effect to every word on the premise that a testator did not will in vain. CSF therefore did not breach his duty to make sufficient inquiry into the CMJ Joint Accounts.
* The double portions contention. The presumption against double portions provided that a parent’s gift by will, that gift being a portion, was adeemed when he provided a portion to the child during his lifetime. This form of ademption was based on the rebuttable presumption that a testator who was a parent (or a person in loco parentis) did not intend to provide double portions to his children. The testator was presumed to have intended the portion provided during the testator’s lifetime as a substitution for the legacy. However, this form of ademption applied only where the will predated the inter vivos gift because the inter vivos gift accelerated the enjoyment of the provisions of the will. CSK’s argument that the presumption against double portions applied in the present case because the father had made an inter vivos gift to CMJ a decade before his death failed. The reason was that the Will was made after the inter vivos gift.
* The sale proceeds of the Killiney property. Proprietary interests under a resulting trust crystallised at the time of purchase and did not fluctuate as and when a party made payments towards reducing the loan over time. In this regard, the identity of the borrower or mortgagor was not determinative of the parties’ agreement or understanding as to who was to repay the loan. In addition, subsequent conduct might be evidence of the agreement or understanding. Here, CSK failed to prove that there existed any clear agreement or common understanding between the father and CMJ at the time the Killiney property was purchased. There was also no evidence that the father paid any of the loan instalments. There was therefore no purchase price resulting trust in favour of the father. CMJ was entitled to 50% of the net proceeds of sale of the Killiney property. CSF had therefore discharged his duty to inquire into the disposal of the proceeds of sale of the Killiney Property.
* Alternatively, words could be read out for repugnance, inconsistency or senselessness in the context where they were clearly contrary to the intention expressed in the will. Therefore, cl 2 could also be construed as if the phrase “by virtue of the right of survivorship” were omitted. This would make the imperative nature of the donative intent expressed in cl 2 even clearer.
o Trust properties
* Assets placed in an inter vivos trust are not part of a deceased’s estate
o Properties that do not exist/accounts with insufficient monies at the date of death
* A gift fails if the gifted property does not exist at the testator’s death. This is the principle of ademption. If there is insufficient money to pay cash gifts, then the legacies are reduced and this is known as abatement, meaning each beneficiary takes pari passu.
o Gifts
* Generally, a gift by will lapses if a beneficiary dies before the testator If there are no gift over beneficiaries then the gift falls into the residuary estate for distribution under the residuary clause. HOWEVER as regards gifts of whatever kind to a testator’s named child:
* If A leaves issue as at the date of death, any gift from A’s father to A will not lapse, but pursuant to section 26 Wills Act, the gift will go to A’s estate for distribution unless a contrary intention is stated in the Will)
* Re Will of Loke Soh Lui, deceased [1997] 3 SLR(R) 956
o Whether section 26 of the Wills Act operates depends on how the children are described in the will
o Section 26 of the Wills Act operates where the children are named; if the name child passes before the testator, his/her share is reverted back to the testator’s estate for distribution.
o If the testator wishes for the failed gift to pass to someone else other than to the named deceased child’s estate, an express clause in the will must indicate this contrary intention.
* Section 26 of the Wills Act does not apply to class gifts
o Gift automatically lapses vis à vis the deceased child gift will be redistributed to the rest of the surviving children in equal shares
o If one wishes for the gift to pass to the deceased child’s issue, must include an express clause in the Will indicating so, if the gift is drafted as a gift to a class of children

- Avoidance of partial intestacy
o A partial intestacy can arise where a will does not name executors or where all executors have predeceased the testator and the will does not name any substitute executor. In such cases the estate is considered intestate and a grant of letters of administration with will annexed (instead of a grant of probate) will have to be applied for.
o A partial intestacy can also arise where the will does not dispose of some part of the testator’s estate which is capable of passing under a will or did not provide for a residuary clause to deal with assets not specifically disposed of. The beneficiaries of such undisposed assets are those persons who take upon the intestacy of the testator.
o See section 10 Intestate Succession Act ISA.
* Where any person dies leaving a will beneficially disposing of part of his property, the provisions of this Act shall have effect as respects the part of his property not so disposed of, subject to the provisions contained in the will:
* Provided that the personal representative shall, subject to his rights and powers for the purposes of administration, be a trustee for the persons entitled under this Act in respect of the part of the estate not expressly disposed of unless it appears by the will that the personal representative is entitled to take that part beneficially.
- Provision for the welfare of the deceased’s dependents
o The Inheritance (Family Provision) Act allows for certain dependents to apply to alter the distribution of the deceased’s estate for the maintenance of a dependent not provided for under a will.
* This does not apply to parent or illegitimate children of the deceased (Low Guang Hong David and Others v Suryono Wino Goei [2012] 3 SLR 185)
- Taking instructions in will-drafting
o Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] SGCA 25
* “there ought to be no room for even the slightest doubt (or the slightest possibility of a mistake) on the part of a solicitor in both understanding the testator’s intention and expressing that intention in the will to be drawn up.”
* “In cases where the construction of the terms of a will is contested, it may be necessary to compare the testimony of the solicitor who drafted the will (“the drafting solicitor”) with his attendance notes since those notes are (or at least should be) a contemporaneous record of the testator’s instructions. A failure on the drafting solicitor’s part to keep proper attendance notes and/or records may have adverse consequences. This omission could persuade the court to doubt the veracity of the drafting solicitor’s testimony if a dispute arises as to the purport of the terms of the will the court may even draw adverse inferences against the drafting solicitor”.
o Questions to ask yourself as a lawyer
* Rule 25 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015)
* A solicitor/law practice must not act for the client in the drafting of a will where the solicitor, his partner, director, consultant or employee or their immediate family members will be a beneficiary.
* The Law Society of Singapore v Lee Suet Fern [2020] SGDT 1
* What does the client want to do?
* Can what he is asking for be done?
* Does the will accurately reflect his intentions?
* When must the will be prepared?
* How long have you known the testator?
* Who introduced you to the testator?
* On what date did you receive instructions from the testator?
* Did you receive instructions via telephone / email?
* If instructions were taken at a meeting include contemporaneous notes of the meeting, the advice given to the testator, where the meeting took place and who else was present at the meeting?
* Did the testator exhibit any signs of confusion or loss of memory?
* How were the provisions of the will explained to the testator?
* Can the testator read English? If not, in what language / dialect was the will interpreted and read out to the testator?
- Law Society of Singapore – Ethics Committee Guidance Note – “Ethical Considerations in Preparing and Witnessing the Execution of a Will” – Law Gazette, April 2011
o There is no ethical rule prohibiting a solicitor who drafted his client’s will or another solicitor from the same law practice from being appointed as the executor/trustee under that will, if the solicitor who is acting as executor/trustee is not a beneficiary/legatee under the will.
o Rule 46 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (“PCR”) only prohibits a solicitor from acting for the client in preparing a will under which he would receive a significant gift, whether as a beneficiary or otherwise.
o Where Rule 46 of the PCR does not apply, a solicitor who drafted the will, or another solicitor in the same law practice can be appointed as the executor/trustee under the same will. Nevertheless, a solicitor acting as an executor/trustee under a will ought to bear in mind the following principles:
* A solicitor-trustee acting on behalf of a trust estate is not, in the absence of a clause giving him that power in the will under which he is a trustee, entitled to charge or recover anything from the trust estate for profit costs.
* The solicitor would be entitled to out of pocket expenditure, but not to profit from being an executor. This principle is based on the consideration that equity will not allow a man to place himself in a position in which his interest and duty are in conflict.
* A solicitor should not act if a conflict of interest arises, for example, under rules 25(a) and 26 PCR. “If the solicitor might be perceived as anything less than a completely independent adviser to the testator, he ought not, as a matter of good practice, to be involved in the explanation, the interpretation and the execution of the will. In particular, exceptional restraint and care are called for if the solicitor concerned has a pre-existing relationship and/or past dealings with the sole beneficiary under a will, and all the more so if the will has been prepared urgently and executed in unusual circumstances with that sole beneficiary’s active involvement.
* As the solicitor is effectively his firm’s client, it may be good practice for the solicitor to provide some information to the beneficiaries under the will, such as the type of work to be carried out and approximate timescales: see UK Solicitors’ Code of Conduct r 2.02(26). Care must, however, be taken to ensure that unless the solicitor intends to treat the beneficiaries under the will as his clients, he should not act in such a manner that an implied retainer may be construed to arise between him and the beneficiaries.
Conflicts of interest, ethical issues and professional negligence
- Risk of conflict of interest
o Mahidon Nichiar bte Mohd v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin [2015] 5 SLR 62 
* There were at least four potential issues that the Appellants ought to have been specifically alerted to, and their confirmation sought, when the solicitors met them for the first and only time on 27 February 2004: 
* (a) Did they trust and intend Dawood to be the sole administrator of Father’s estate, and, so, to be able to deal with its assets in that capacity? 
* (b) Did they understand the terms of the Second Certificate, and, in so far as the Three Siblings were concerned, did they in fact intend to unconditionally renounce their respective interests in Father’s estate in favour of Mother and Dawood alone, contrary to the terms of the Second Certificate? 
* (c) Were they aware of the possible difference in consequences of the Property being held by Mother and Dawood as joint tenants rather than as tenants in common? 
* (d) Were Dawood’s factual instructions to the solicitors on all of the above matters accurate and reflective of their own intentions?
* The call for care on the part of the solicitors was enhanced by the fact that the solicitors were acting concurrently for parties with potentially conflicting interests. This need was even more pressing given that one party (Dawood) had assumed the mantle of being the group representative for dealings with the solicitors, appeared to pay entirely for the legal expenses incurred, and gave to the solicitors all the instructions which, if carried into effect, would benefit him.
* Where, in a given matter, a solicitor acts for multiple clients (or groups of clients) with conflicting interests, and where one client (or group of clients) enters into a transaction which prejudices him and benefits the conflicting interests of another client (or group of clients) who is also represented by the same solicitor, that transaction would be regarded as suspect and would be liable to be set aside in the absence of clear evidence that the solicitor did in fact fully advise the client (or group of clients) who was prejudiced as to the terms and effect of the transaction.
* There was no blanket prohibition against solicitors acting in the same matter for multiple clients with ostensibly conflicting interests. However, solicitors were under a duty to obtain the informed consent of all the clients before so acting.
* In obtaining such informed consent, it was of the first importance that the solicitor communicated directly with the clients and, in so doing, explained to them the nature of the potential conflict and the constraints on the solicitor in such a situation.
* Throughout the course of the retainer, the solicitor should also be mindful of the importance of: (a) keeping proper contemporaneous records of all instructions received from and advice rendered to the clients; and (b) keeping the clients reasonably informed of the progress of the matter.
o Kuek Siang Wei v Kuek Siew Chew [2015] 5 SLR 357 
* A solicitor who was approached by an administrator or an executor of an estate for his advice might owe duties not just to the individual who approached him for his advice, but also to the other potential beneficiaries. The solicitor had to be cognisant of the possibility of a conflict of interest arising in such circumstances.
* A solicitor in Mr Chia’s situation should have first attempted to fully apprehend each beneficiary’s interest in the winding up of the deceased’s estate. This would have required the solicitor to come to terms with not just each beneficiary’s pecuniary interest, but also any relevant non-pecuniary interest which each beneficiary might have had in the matter.
* Having understood each beneficiary’s interest, the solicitor would then have had to direct his mind to the issue of whether the various beneficiaries’ interests were conflicting or potentially conflicting in any way. If there was a potential or actual conflict of interest, the solicitor would have had to consider whether it was possible for him to act for all the beneficiaries in a competent and even-handed manner without compromising any beneficiary’s interests.
* If the solicitor considered that he could do so, he would have had to obviate the conflict by seeking all the beneficiaries’ informed consent to his acting on behalf of all of them notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The solicitor would have had to extricate himself from the conflict by declining to act for one or more of the parties if he considered that it was impossible for him to discharge his obligations towards all the beneficiaries. If the solicitor continued to act for only one or some of the parties, he had to take steps expeditiously to ensure that the other parties were not labouring under the assumption that he continued to act on their behalf.
* A solicitor would have had to communicate directly with diversely interested beneficiaries if he decided to deal with an actual or potential conflict of interest by obtaining the informed consent of all the beneficiaries whom he intended to represent. The duty to communicate directly with diversely interested beneficiaries would not necessarily have ended once the solicitor had obtained their informed consent. Rather, this obligation might well have continued throughout the course of the retainer.
o Gifts from clients (Rule 25 Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015) 
* The legal practitioner or law practice –
* Must not act for the client in relation to the gift; and
* Must advise the client to obtain independent legal advice in relation to the gift.
- Professional negligence
o White v Jones [1995] 2 AC 207
* A man, Mr White, wished to change his will so as to leave £9000 for the benefit of his two daughters, who he had chosen to exclude at the point of his will’s initial drafting. His solicitor was the defendant, Mr Jones, who received Mr White’s request but took a sizable time to actually implement it. In this time period, Mr White passed away and the will remained unchanged. Subsequently, Mr White’s daughters, the claimants, brought an action against the defendant, contending the amount of time it took for him to fulfil the request amounted to professional negligence and attempting to claim the amount that they would have received had the will been altered.
* The House of Lords found 3-2 for the claimants, determining that Mr Jones’s negligent behaviour did provide grounds for a claim by others, even where no prior contractual or fiduciary relationship existed. The Court applied the three part test stated in Caparo Industries v Dickman [1990] UKHL 2), finding that the loss caused by Mr Jones’s delay was reasonably foreseeable, that a sufficiently proximate relationship could be identified between Mr White’s daughters and Mr Jones, and lastly that it would be fair, just and reasonable for liability to be imposed.
o Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR (R) 1079
* At [38]: “In cases where the construction of the terms of a will is contested, it may be necessary to compare the testimony of the solicitor who drafted the will (“the drafting solicitor”) with his attendance notes since those notes are (or at least should be) a contemporaneous record of the testator’s instructions. A failure on the drafting solicitor’s part to keep proper attendance notes and/or records may have adverse consequences. This omission could persuade the court to doubt the veracity of the drafting solicitor’s testimony if a dispute arises as to the purport of the terms of the will; the court may even draw adverse inferences against the drafting solicitor.”
o Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline [2010] 4 SLR 373
* At [60], the Court of Appeal noted that if a testator was known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she was allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator fully understood the will. Furthermore, the solicitor should ask the appropriate questions to ascertain the testator’s capacity to understand the contents of the will. The testator should be asked as simple a question as whether he or she was making a will for the first time or whether he or she had made a will. In the latter case, the solicitor should ask whether the testator knew he was revoking the existing will. These questions might be formulaic, but they were necessary to avoid cases of the nature that we had decided. Finally, as a matter of good professional practice, if not professional prudence, the solicitor should make a contemporary written record of his or her attendances on the testator so that he or she would be able to recall exactly what had transpired during the meeting or meetings.
o Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC v AEL [2015] 4 SLR 325
* A perusal of the cases reveals that the solicitors were liable not because there was no way to redistribute the testator’s assets according to the defective will but because the solicitors were negligent and the disappointed beneficiaries were in a proximate enough relationship to the solicitors to warrant a finding of liability against the solicitors.
o Mahidon Nichiar bte Mohd v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin [2015] 5 SLR 62
* First, it was clear that Mr Singh took a perfunctory approach towards the First Certificate which he had been shown on 19 February 2004. On his own evidence, he did not stop to inquire into its origins and this made his position untenable because it should have occurred to him that its omission of the Three Siblings was traceable to Dawood, who could likely have been improperly motivated to exclude his siblings from Father’s estate.
* Next, on 24 February 2004, Mr Singh was evidently untroubled by Dawood’s fresh instructions which signalled a dramatic change in the Three Siblings’ position to their obvious detriment and to Dawood’s benefit. He was oblivious to any concerns as to when the alleged agreement among the Three Siblings to give up their interests in favour of Mother and Dawood could or might have been formed. In these circumstances, to put it at its lowest, Mr Singh remained blissfully ignorant of the risks to the Three Siblings’ interests that attended their execution of the RBI Deed.
* Finally, the solicitors gave evidence that, at the signing of the RBI Deed (among other probate papers) on 27 February 2004, Mr Singh “must have” explained the document to the Three Siblings. However, that was a bare assertion against which the following factors had to be considered: (a) first, there were no contemporaneous notes supporting the solicitors’ assertion; (b) second, the solicitors’ assertion was based on their recollection of matters which took place ten years ago in the ordinary course of business; (c) third, the assertion was itself self-serving; and, (d) fourth, all the evidence up to this critical juncture pointed towards the fact that the solicitors were oblivious to the conflict in the interests of the parties, which, ultimately, shed light on how poorly focused their minds would have been on the need to explain the grave consequences contemplated by the RBI Deed and how that differed from the quite different agreement to constitute Dawood as the sole administrator of Father’s estate.
* The Three Siblings were also not negligent in signing the RBI Deed. They were a group of lay clients who had gone to the solicitors in the expectation that the latter would look out for and advise them properly as to their interests in connection with the execution of a document that formed part of a set of probate papers dealing with a somewhat complicated arrangement. In these circumstances, the mistaken belief which the Three Siblings were labouring under when they signed the RBI Deed was more properly attributable to the inadequate discharge by the solicitors of their duties than any negligence or carelessness on their part.
o Kuek Siang Wei v Kuek Siew Chew [2015] 5 SLR 357
* Mr Chia’s handling of the administration of Mr Kuek’s estate fell short in almost every respect. First, he failed to understand the Respondent’s interest in the winding up of the estate. Second, he was oblivious to the possibility of a conflict of interest between Hock Eng’s family on the one hand, and the Respondent, Mdm Lim and Siew Eng on the other. Third, he repeatedly failed to communicate material information directly to the Respondent, Mdm Lim and Siew Eng. He did not tell them, prior to the execution of the Deed of Consent, that the second family’s claim for a share of Mr Kuek’s estate under the intestacy regime set out in the ISA had a significant likelihood of success; he also did not inform them of the total value of Mr Kuek’s estate even though he already had this information as at 23 June 2010; and he ceased communicating with the Respondent, Mdm Lim and Siew Eng altogether after the Deed of Consent was signed and was content to rely on Mdm Ho’s assurance that she was keeping the Respondent, Mdm Lim and Siew Eng informed of the details of the negotiations between the two families. Lastly, Mr Chia prevaricated and failed to come clean even when the Respondent pressed him for details concerning the size of Mr Kuek’s residuary estate at the 7 May 2012 meeting.
o The Law Society of Singapore v Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern) [2020] SGDT 1
* At [588]: “Considered in totality, the Respondent’s conduct was quite dishonest. Mr LHY’s and her conduct, demonstrated a calculated attempt to:
* (a)   Ensure that Mr Lee executed the Last Will as quickly as possible, without due regard for Mr Lee’s wishes, and
* (b)   Hide their wrongdoing in having done so.”
* At [589]: “The Respondent and Mr LHY knew that it was important to Mr Lee to have a lawyer prepare and arrange for the execution of the Last Will. Despite this: (a) they cut out Mr Lee’s usual lawyer, Ms KKL, and replaced her with the Respondent, who was in a serious conflict of interest; and (b) instead of advising Mr Lee to seek independent counsel, as she was required to, the Respondent acquiesced in Mr LHY’s representation to Mr Lee, that it was best to proceed without Ms KKL; and actively ensured that the execution could proceed without Ms KKL.”
* At [590]: “Having removed Ms KKL from the picture, the Respondent compounded her wrongdoing by misleading Mr Lee on the contents of the Last Will. She and Mr LHY also rushed the signing of the Last Will by Mr Lee. It contained terms which had not been discussed with Mr Lee (see paragraphs 536 – 538 above). Mr Lee signed the Last Will under false assurances.”


- Differences between intestate and testate estates
o When a testator dies, his estate vests in executors and they handle the deceased’s affairs subject to the production of the grant of probate.
o In an intestacy situation i e where someone has died without a will, the estate vests in the Public Trustee (s 37 PAA) until a grant of letters of administration has been obtained by personal representatives called administrators.
o The entitlement to the deceased’s estate is determined by statute (Intestate Succession Act) and the question of who can be an administrator of an intestate’s estate is determined by the priority of entitlement to the estate as set out in the ISA So let’s look at the relevant section of the ISA.
o Section 6 of the Intestate Succession Act:
* No distinction to be made between those related to the deceased through his father and those who are related to him through his mother
* No distinction to be made between those who were actually born in the deceased’s lifetime and those who at the date of his death were only conceived in the womb but who have subsequently been born alive
* Those related to the deceased by half blood shall rank immediately after those of the whole blood related to him in the same degree

o The distribution of the immovable property of a person deceased shall be regulated by this Act wherever he may have been domiciled at the time of his death (lex situs).
- Section 5: If a person dies intestate after the commencement of this Act, he being at the time of his death –
o (a) domiciled in Singapore and possessed beneficially of property, whether movable or immovable, or both, situated in Singapore, or
o (b) domiciled outside Singapore and possessed beneficially of immovable property situated in Singapore,
that that property or the proceeds thereof … shall be distributed among the persons entitled to succeed beneficially thereto.

o Both sections 6(a) and (b) apply; but based on 6(a), it was a draw between the parties. Based on 6(b), the whole blood aunt won.
o Section 7 rule 8 of the ISA had to be interpreted in the light of, and subject to, s6(b) of the ISA.  The aunt of the deceased who shared the same parents as the deceased’s mother was the sole beneficiary of the deceased’s estate to the exclusion of the plaintiffs as she was a whole blood aunt of the deceased, unlike the plaintiffs who were the half blood aunts and half blood uncle of the deceased.
- Section 7: Distribution under intestacy succession rules
o Rule 1: If an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse, no issue and no parent, the spouse shall be entitled to the whole of the estate.
o Rule 2: If an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse and issue, the spouse shall be entitled to one-half of the estate.
o Rule 3: Subject to the rights of the surviving spouse, if any, the estate … of an intestate who leaves issue shall be distributed by equal portions per stirpes to and amongst the children of the person dying intestate and such persons as legally represent those children, in case any of those children be then dead.
* Proviso No. (1) —The persons who legally represent the children of an intestate are their descendants and not their next-of-kin.
* This clarifies that if a child (“X”) of the intestate had predeceased him, and X had descendants who survived him, those descendants are the ones who are entitled to inherit. X’s spouse (i.e. the intestate’s child-in-law) will not be entitled to inherit at all. 
* If X had no descendants, then Proviso 1 does not apply.  The other surviving children (or their descendants, if any other child had also predeceased the intestate) will share equally the Rule 3 entitlement.
* Proviso No. (2) —Descendants of the intestate to the remotest degree stand in the place of their parent or other ancestor, and take according to their stocks the share which he or she would have taken.
* This is the per stirpes rule and shows that the distribution to descendants, where applicable, can extend to the grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc. of an intestate.
o Rule 4: If an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse and no issue but a parent or parents, the spouse shall be entitled to one-half of the estate and the parent or parents to the other half of the estate.
o Rule 5: If there are no descendants the parent or parents of the intestate shall take the estate, in equal portions if there be two parents.
* Interesting, if the deceased was an illegitimate child, Rules 4 and 5 must be read with Legitimacy Act, Section 10(2), and only the mother is entitled.
o Rule 6: If there are no surviving spouse, descendants or parents, the brothers and sisters and children of deceased brothers or sisters of the intestate shall share the estate in equal portions between the brothers and sisters and the children of any deceased brother or sister shall take according to their stocks the share which he or she would have taken.
o Rule 7: If there are no surviving spouse, descendants, parents, brothers and sisters or children of such brothers and sisters but grandparents of the intestate the grandparents shall take the whole of the estate in equal portions.
o Rule 8: If there are no surviving spouse, descendants, parents, brothers and sisters or their children or grandparents but uncles and aunts of the intestate the uncles and aunts shall take the whole of the estate in equal portions.
o Rule 9: bona vacantia; In default of distribution under the foregoing rules the Government shall be entitled to the whole of the estate.
- Legitimacy Act 1934
o Section 2:
* “court” means the General Division of the High Court or a Family Court;
* “date of legitimation” means the date of the marriage leading to the legitimation, or, where the marriage occurred before 18 May 1934, that day;
* “disposition” means an assurance of any interest in property by any instrument whether inter vivos or by will;
* “intestate” includes a person who leaves a will but dies intestate as to some beneficial interest in his estate;
* “legitimated person” means a person legitimated by this Act;
* “will” includes “codicil”.
o Section 3
* Subject to this section, where the parents of an illegitimate person marry or have married one another, whether before, on or after 18 May 1934 the marriage shall, if the father or mother of the illegitimate person was or is at the date of the marriage domiciled in Singapore, render that person, if living, legitimate from 18 May 1934 or from the date of the marriage, whichever last happens.
* Nothing in this Act shall operate to legitimate a person unless the marriage leading to the legitimation was solemnised and registered in accordance with the provisions of the repealed Christian Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 37, 1955 Revised Edition) or of the Civil Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 38, 1955 Revised Edition) or unless that marriage was registered or deemed to be registered under the Women’s Charter 1961.
* The legitimation of a person under this Act does not enable him or his spouse, children or remoter issue to take any interest in property save as hereinafter expressly provided in this Act.
o Section 10
* Where, on or after 18 May 1934, the mother of an illegitimate child, the child not being a legitimated person, dies intestate as respects all or any of her property, and does not leave any legitimate issue her surviving, the illegitimate child, or if he is dead his issue, shall be entitled to take any interest therein to which he or his issue would have been entitled if he had been born legitimate.
* Where, on or after 18 May 1934, an illegitimate child, not being a legitimated person, dies intestate as respects all or any of his property, his mother, if surviving, shall be entitled to take any interest therein to which she would have been entitled if the child had been born legitimate and she had been the only surviving parent.
- Section 7(2) Adoption of Children Act 1939/Section 47 Adoption of Children Act 2022
o Where, at any time after the making of an adoption order —
* (a)	the adopter or the adopted person or any other person dies intestate in respect of any movable or immovable property, that property shall devolve in all respects as if the adopted person were the child of the adopter born in lawful wedlock and not the child of any other person;
- Lim Weipin v Lim Boh Chuan [2010] 3 SLR 423
o This was insufficient to establish a claim under the Intestate Succession Act, which excludes illegitimate children from succession. Section 9(1) of the Legitimacy Act(Cap 162, 1985 Red Ed) could not be relied upon as there was no evidence that LY was legitimised in accordance with Chinese law after her mother married LHC. The presumption of similarity of laws, assuming it applied, would not assist LY as Singapore law allowed a child to be legitimised when its parents married, and not simply on any subsequent marriage of the mother with another man. LY did not prove that she was the biological daughter of LHC.
- Whole blood
o The relationship existing between persons having the same two parents; unmixed ancestry.
- Half blood
o The relationship existing between persons having the same father or mother, but not both parents in common.
- Section 9: Where a distributive share of the property of a person dying intestate is claimed by a child or any descendant of a child of that person no money or other property which the intestate may during his life have given, paid or settled to or for the advancement of the child by whom or by whose descendant the claim is made shall be taken into account in estimating such distributive share.
o Note: This only applies the entitlements of the child (or his descendants) but not to the others, e.g. spouse, parents, siblings, etc.
- Section 10 (partial intestacy): Where any person dies leaving a will beneficially disposing of part of his property, … this Act shall have effect as respects the part of his property not so disposed of, subject to the provisions contained in the will: 
o Provided that the personal representative shall, subject to his rights and powers for the purposes of administration, be a trustee for the persons entitled under this Act in respect of the part of the estate not expressly disposed of unless it appears by the will that the personal representative is entitled to take that part beneficially. (similar to section 24 of the Civil Law Act)
o S 10 (helpfully provides that with regard to the intestate estate, “the provisions of the ISA shall have effect subject to the provisions contained in the will” This phrase is absent from the CLA.
- Section 24, Civil Law Act: Executor deemed to be trustee for person entitled to residue on intestacy
o When any person dies or has died, having by his will appointed any person to be his executor, such executor shall be deemed to be a trustee for the person, if any, who would be entitled to the estate in case the person died intestate in respect of any residue not expressly disposed of, unless it appears by the will that the person so appointed executor was intended to take such residue beneficially.
o The executor of the will should simply apply for grant of probate of the will, notwithstanding the partial intestacy The Executor does not need to apply for a separate grant of letters of administration, even if there are infant beneficiaries of the intestate portion of the estate The Executor’s powers and duties are spelled out in both S 10 ( and S 24 (and also the will, if applicable)
o Note that ISA S 10 uses “personal representatives” whereas CLA S 24 refers to “executor”. Quaere: is there any difference in the applications of the provisions?
- Child
o Legitimate child
o Illegitimate child
* AAG v Estate of AAH [2010] 1 SLR 0769
* Illegitimate child is not a “child” under the ISA
* To permit an illegitimate child to claim for maintenance against his or her deceased parent’s estate would be to indirectly allow that child to claim for a share in the intestate parent’s estate, contrary to the ISA.
* A child who remains illegitimate is entitled to the intestate estate of his mother in the event that the mother does not leave any legitimate children. The illegitimate child takes the estate as if he was the legitimate child of the mother. (Legitimacy Act, S. 10).
o Step-child
* Low Guang Hong David & Ors v Suryono Wino Goei [2012] 3 SLR 185
* Tay Yong Kwang J held that “child” under section 3 of the ISA cannot be interpreted as including a step child.  The main meaning of “child” was “legitimate child”, and the enlarged definition was “adopted child”.  Taken as a whole and in its proper context, the ISA requires a legal and biological connection between parent and child and hence, the exception for lawfully adopted children who satisfy the legal but not the biological requirement.
* The Court observed that it is therefore incumbent on step-parents wishing to provide for their step-children’s entitlement to their estate to expressly state so in a proper will.
o Foster child
* Lim Weipin v Lim Boh Chuan [2010] 3 SLR 423
* Foster children are not “children” under the ISA.
o Adopted child
o ‘disowned’ child
Inheritance (Family) Provision Act
- Firstly, Section 1(2) of the Act states that the Act does not apply to the estates of deceased Muslims.
- Secondly, in section 3(1) states that the Act only applies where a person dies domiciled in Singapore. 
- It is therefore important if one is advising clients on an IFPA matter to ascertain that the deceased person was domiciled in Singapore and was not a Muslim.
- Only “Dependants” can claim
o Section 3(1): “Dependants” for the purposes of the IFPA are:
* a wife or husband;
* a daughter who has not been married* or who is, by reason of some mental or physical disability, incapable of maintaining herself;
* (*in Jeanne Christine Monteiro v Ling Mie Hean [1997] SGHC 296, the unmarried Daughter was 61 years old).
* an infant son; or
* a son who is, by reason of some mental or physical disability, incapable of maintaining himself.
o Section 2 of the IFPA: son and daughter means:
* A male or female child adopted by the deceased by virtue of an order made under the provisions of any written law relating to the adoption of children for the time being in force in Singapore, Malaysia or Brunei Darussalam, and also
* The son or daughter of the deceased en ventre sa mere at the date of the death of the deceased.
“env entre sa mere” literally means in the mother’s womb so if
the child was conceived and in the womb of the mother when the father
dies, such child, after his birth, would be entitled to claim for provision
from the estate of the deceased father.
- Soh Siew Yok v Ching Kwong Yew [1991] SGHC 37 (“Soh’s case”)
o It is provided at section 3 (1) of the IFPA that if the court in this case it means an Family Justice Court (see definition of “family proceedings” in Section 2 of the Family Justice Act) - on an application by or on behalf of the dependants is of the opinion that the disposition of a deceased estate which is effected by his will or under the law relating to intestacy or a combination of both the Will and intestacy is not such as to make reasonable provision for the maintenance of that dependant, the court may order that such reasonable provision as the court thinks fit shall, subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the court may impose, be made out of the deceased’s net estate for the maintenance of that dependant. However where the disposition of a deceased’s estate is such that the surviving spouse is entitled to not less than two-thirds of the income of the net estate and where the only other dependant or dependants (if any) is or are a child or children of the surviving spouse, then the claim will fail.
- Time limits under section 4 and 6 of the IFPA
o Section 4(1): “6(six) months from the date on which representation in regard to the deceased’s estate is first taken out.”
* Section 4(2): This 6 months period may be extended if the Court is satisfied that the 6 months would operate unfairly:
* in consequence of the discovery of a will or codicil involving a substantial change in the disposition of the deceased’s estate (whether or not involving a further grant of representation)
* in consequence of a question whether a person had an interest in the estate or as to the nature of an interest in the estate, not having been determined at the time when representation was first taken out; or
* in consequence of some other circumstances affecting the administration or distribution of the estate
o Section 6(1): after the time period in section 4, the court may make such order “only as respects property the income of which is at that date applicable for the maintenance of a dependant of the deceased”
* an order for varying the previous order on the ground that a material fact was not disclosed to the court when the order was made, or that a substantial change has taken place in the circumstances of the dependant or of a person beneficially interested in the property under the will or, as the case may be, under the law relating to intestacy; or
* an order for making provision for the maintenance of another dependant of the deceased
- What the Court can order under IFPA
o Periodical payments (section 3(2) subject to section 3(4)) that will terminate no later than –
* in the case of a wife or husband, her or his remarriage;
* in the case of a daughter who has not been married, or who is under disability, her marriage or the cesser of her disability, whichever is the later;
* in the case of an infant son, his attaining the age of 21 years;
* in the case of a son under disability, the cesser of his disability,;
or in any case, his or her earlier death.
o Section 3(4) provides that if the deceased’s net estate does not exceed $50 000 in value, the Court has the power to make an order providing for maintenance in whole or in part by way of a lump sum payment.
* APZ v AQA – IFPA [2011] 3 SLR 1110
* Mother felt that the husband’s bequeath in his will of $10,000 to their son (they divorced) was insufficient. Accordingly, she applied under s 3(1)(c) of the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act (Cap 138, 1985 Rev Ed) (“IFPA”) for an order that a lump sum payment of $250,000 be made out of MB’s estate as reasonable provision for her infant son’s maintenance.
* By making an order under the IFPA, the court would be interfering with what would normally be the testator’s privilege to dispose of his own money in his own way. The purpose of the IFPA was thus limited to the provision of reasonable maintenance and not for the purpose of obtaining legacies out of the testator’s estate. This was evidenced in the wording of section 3(1) which stated that “if the court … is of the opinion that [the will does not] make reasonable provision” not that the testator has acted unreasonably. Outside of section 3(4), the IFPA did not envisage any capital payment, and the court was not empowered to make such an order. Therefore, if an order for provision of maintenance was to be made under section 3(1), the statutorily prescribed method for provision of maintenance out of the net estate was by way of periodical payments. Under section 3(3), periodic payments were not to be at an annual rate that exceeded the annual income of the net estate. The words “when realised” in s section 2 IFPA suggested, as a matter of construction, that the annual income had to be received by the estate before it could be distributed.
* In a proper case, it was possible that having regard to the matters to which the court was to pay attention to under sections 3(6) and 3(7), the court might conclude that in the circumstances no provision be ordered. An example was where the court found that the testator had in his lifetime given substantial inter vivos gifts to the dependant and, hence, concluded that in the circumstances it was reasonable not to grant the application. Put another way, a nil provision might in the end be regarded as a reasonable provision given the circumstances of the case.
* Jeanne Christine Monteiro suing by her sister and next friend Monteiro Hyacinth Irene alias Monteiro Irene Anne v Ling Mie Hean and Another [1997] SGHC 296
* At [9]: “In construing whether the testator had made a disposition of his estate without making reasonable provisions for persons entitled to such provisions under section 3 of the Act, the court is entitled, and indeed, ought to consider any inter vivos gift by the testator to such applicants. If a testator had made adequate inter vivos provisions for the persons entitled under section 3(1), the court should not interfere with his right to determine who should have the benefit of his estate.”
- Effect of a successful IFPA application
o Section 5(1): “shall be deemed to have had effect as from the deceased’s death, subject to such variations as may be specified in the order for the purpose of giving effect to the provision for such maintenance thereby made”
o AAG v Estate of AAH (deceased) [2010] 1 SLR 769
* The applicant had sought on behalf of her 2 illegitimate daughters for maintenance out of the estate of the deceased under the IFPA. The defendants/respondents were the administrators of the estate of the natural father of the illegitimate children. The sole issue in the appeal was whether an illegitimate child could claim for support and maintenance under the IFPA.
* The High Court and Court of Appeal held that IFPA does not allow illegitimate children to claim maintenance under the act.
o AOS v Estate of AOT (deceased) [2012] 3 SLR 721
* Widow had a stormy marriage with her late husband, the testator, and commenced divorce proceedings, with a decree nisi being granted, but before ancillary matters could be determined, the testator died.
* Under his will, the testator gave his entire estate to his 8 year old grandson and nothing to his wife (the applicant) or his other children. The widow filed an IFPA application for herself and her 3 adult children.
* The Court held that the 2 adult male children who were studying overseas were not dependants and not eligible to claim under the IFPA, nor could in any case the mother claim on their behalf.
* The eldest son, aged 35 with cerebral palsy and obsessive compulsive disorder, had to make his own application and his mother could not apply for him.
* On the widow’s application for $20,000 a month or an alternative lump sum payment of $7.2 million, the Court of Appeal thought that in light of the inter vivos gifts that the testator had given to the appellant and her stated monthly expenses being less than the income that she was receiving, that there was no need to disturb the decision made by the High Court not to allow any further provision under the IFPA.
* The Court of Appeal reiterated that the IFPA is concerned with maintenance and not the creation of legacies The appellant’s prayers were far in excess of what constituted reasonable maintenance under the IFPA. In claiming for half of the testator's estate, the appellant was seeking to incorporate the provisions of the Women's Charter concerning just and equitable division of matrimonial assets between divorcing parties into the IFPA. The Court of Appeal said they had no power to do so.

MUST READ CASES
- Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079
o Appellants sought a declaration that the respondent was a mere executor of the testator’s residuary estate, and that the estate was subject to various trusts created ny the testator in their favour. The Testator’s will (“the Will”) stated that the respondent be appointed executor and trustee, and that his wife be appointed as the alternate executrix. Ex facie, the Will also provided that the Estate be given to the respondent “ON TRUST to be distributed to [himself]”. 
o The Will was drafted while the Testator was unwell and was witnessed by Alan Lee Soo Yuen (“Alan Lee”), the solicitor who took instructions from the Testator on the drafting of the Will, and one Lua Cheng Eng (“Lua”). Alan Lee testified that in early November 2000, the Testator after having been diagnosed with malignant lymphoma telephoned him to instruct him to draw up a will leaving “everything” to the respondent. Alan Lee then instructed a junior solicitor (“the Junior Solicitor”) to prepare the Will. The Will was executed by the Testator in his hospital ward on 27 November 2000 and two doctors (“the doctors”) who were present certified that the Testator was of sound mind.
o The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.
o In construing a will, the court was to ascertain, objectively, the testator’s expressed intention as was declared and apparent in the will. The words used in the will were prima facie to be given their ordinary meaning, with legal and technical words to be given their legal or technical meaning unless it clearly appeared from the face of the will that they were intended to bear some other meaning.
o If the testator’s expressed intention was ambiguous on the face of the will, relevant extrinsic evidence might be admitted as an aid to construction. Such evidence was not admissible for the purpose of altering the will but to enable the court to understand it.
o The way in which the Will was drafted gave rise to several legal difficulties, chief of which was the appointment of the respondent as the sole trustee and sole beneficiary of the Estate. This was not possible at law for one could not be a trustee for oneself. The respondent and his witnesses gave no reasonable explanation for the peculiar drafting of the Will. In the light of the patent ambiguities in the Will, this was a case where the Testator’s expressed intention was not clear on the face of the Will. It was thus appropriate for the court to review all relevant admissible extrinsic evidence for the purposes of construing the Testator’s intention as manifested by the words used in the Will.
o If a particular interpretation of a will which was ambiguous on its face led to an irrational and capricious result, the court would prefer an alternative interpretation that led to a fair, rational and reasonable disposition and distribution of the testator’s estate. In this case, taken in totality, the evidence did not evince an unambiguous intention to exclude the appellants from the distribution of the Estate. This indicated that it was not appropriate to construe the Testator’s intention as manifested in the Will as an intention to leave them with nothing and the respondent with everything. In the result, on a proper construction of the Will, it could not be read to mean that the respondent was the sole beneficiary of the Estate.
o On a reasonable construction of the Will, the testator’s intention as expressed was that the respondent was to hold the Estate on trust for the Testator’s immediate family, with the Estate to be distributed by the respondent in accordance with the rules on intestacy
- Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC v AEL [2015] 4 SLR 325
o Testator executed two wills over his Singapore assets, one in 1990 and one in 2005 after the passing of his wife. He intended to replace the old Indonesian will with the new will and passed away on 24 November 2010. Upon his demise, the second appellant advised the first appellant to obtain probate on the new will, but the application was rejected as the new will was invalid (only executed before one witness when two were needed under statute). While Indonesian legal advice was obtained, eventually, AEL changed solicitors to Siaw Keng Boon (“Siaw”), who obtained the letters of administration on her behalf, and the Singapore Estate was distributed under the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed) (“ISA”).
o The respondents suffered varying degrees of losses; in short, instead of collectively inheriting 90% of the Singapore Estate which they would have had under the New Will, they only collectively inherited about 50% of the Singapore Estate. Three other members of their family also inherited more money than they would have had if the New Will had been valid (“the Unintended Beneficiaries”). As a result, the respondents sued the appellants for negligence in the High Court. They succeeded.
o The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeal. 
o As the subject of ascertaining a testator’s intentions always involved ascertaining the intentions of the dead, the law developed the presumption of revocation in order to provide some certainty and aid in ascertaining those intentions. The presumption of revocation arose when a will was missing at the time of the testator’s death or was found to be torn or mutilated in the testator’s possession and can be rebutted by the doctrine of conditional revocation. No actual destruction of the will was needed. While there was no evidence to show that the Old Will was revoked absolutely by the testator, Cheo was given only a copy of the Old Will, and there was no evidence as to where the original Old Will was. The Old Will was thus presumed revoked.
o There was no reason for s 17(1) of the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed) to bar the operation of the doctrine of conditional revocation. The Wills Act took reference primarily from the English position and extensively mirrored the position in other Commonwealth jurisdictions in which the doctrine of conditional revocation existed despite the existence of statutory provisions in pari materia with s 17(1) of the Wills Act. Moreover, the appellants’ case never engaged s 17(1) of the Wills Act.
o The doctrine of conditional revocation was invoked when a person could show that the revocatory act was referable wholly and solely to the intention of setting up some other testamentary paper. Should the doctrine of conditional revocation be successfully invoked, the presumption against intestacy would then be used as a rule of construction in interpreting the will. Here, the burden of proof lay on the appellants and they failed to trigger the doctrine of conditional revocation – their case was that the Old Will was deliberately withheld by the respondents in order to enlarge the Singapore Estate but that was inconsistent with their claim that there was sufficient evidence of the Old Will’s destruction. Moreover, the legal advice provided by the appellants to the respondents did not ask the latter to obtain probate under the Old Will and that further dented their assertions that the Old Will remained valid.
- George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George [2009] 3 SLR(R) 631
o George had schizophrenia, and executed a will drafted by his father, leaving his entire estate to his nephew and two nieces. His younger brother lodged a caveat against the grant of probate, challenging the validity of the will on his lack of testamentary capacity, lack of knowledge of or absence of approval of the contents of the will and undue influence in the execution of the will.
o The judge at first instance held that the appellant’s father failed to prove that George had testamentary capacity.
o The High Court allowed the appeal, endorsing Banks v Goodfellow at [29] and holding the legal requisites as:
* the testator understood the nature of the act and what its consequences were;
* he knew the extent of his property of which he was disposing, 
* he knew who his beneficiaries were and could appreciate their claims to his property;
* he was free from an abnormal state of mind that might distort feelings of judgments relevant to making the will
- Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline [2010] 4 SLR 373
o Testatrix bequeathed her residuary estate in an earlier will to the respondent, then later sold a half-share in one of her properties to the respondent and the respondent’s husband. This caused the appellant other daughter to be unhappy. The testatrix then was preliminarily diagnosed to be suffering an early onset of dementia and loss of memory. Despite this, the appellant instructed a lawyer to draft another will benefitting her. The trial judge held that this second will was invalid because of medical opinion that the testatrix lacked the requisite testamentary capacity to execute the will, and that the testatrix did not know and approve of the contents of the will.
o The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeal, holding that under ordinary circumstances the reading of a will to a testator not suffering any mental infirmity would be sufficient evidence of his understanding or knowledge of the contents, but that general principle would not apply to a situation where the testator might not have full understanding due to the onset of dementia.
o At [60], the Court of Appeal noted that if a testator was known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she was allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator fully understood the will. Furthermore, the solicitor should ask the appropriate questions to ascertain the testator’s capacity to understand the contents of the will. The testator should be asked as simple a question as whether he or she was making a will for the first time or whether he or she had made a will. In the latter case, the solicitor should ask whether the testator knew he was revoking the existing will. These questions might be formulaic, but they were necessary to avoid cases of the nature that we had decided. Finally, as a matter of good professional practice, if not professional prudence, the solicitor should make a contemporary written record of his or her attendances on the testator so that he or she would be able to recall exactly what had transpired during the meeting or meetings.
- Re BKR [2015] 4 SLR 81
o There was an application made pursuant to the Mental Capacity Act that a woman (“BKR”) was unable to make decisions as to her property and affairs because of an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of her mind or brain. This application was made by two of BKR’s sisters and supported by a number of BKR’s siblings and two of her three children, including her only son. It was opposed by herself, her younger daughter and her son-in-law.
o The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, after the appellant succeeded at first instance but not at the High Court.
o Where there was an interaction between mental impairment and allegations of undue influence in proceedings under the MCA in which a person’s mental capacity was in issue, the court had to have regard to the actual circumstances in which that person lived, and ought not to adopt a theoretical analysis that overlooked those circumstances. In so far as the words “because of” in s 4(1) of the MCA required that there be shown a causative nexus between a person’s mental impairment and her inability to make decisions, there was no additional requirement that her mental impairment be the sole cause of the inability to make decisions. The required causative nexus would be established even where the person’s inability to make decisions was caused by both her mental impairment and actual circumstances.
o Since the court had to have regard to BKR’s actual circumstances in determining whether she lacked mental capacity, it followed that the Judge was wrong to have held that the SDJ at first instance had lacked jurisdiction to hear the application under the MCA just because very substantial allegations of undue influence had been raised. It followed also that the Judge was wrong to have set aside the findings of undue influence made by the SDJ.
o Furthermore, the Judge was wrong to have held that BKR’s responses under cross-examination in court were of little utility in assessing her mental capacity. While cross-examination was a less-than-ideal environment in which to take the measure of a person’s mental capacity, BKR’s clinical interviews were also an unsatisfactory basis for an assessment of mental capacity in that they had not been rigorous or probing enough, and had been conducted by medical professionals who professed to feel sympathy for her. In the circumstances, neither the cross-examination nor clinical interviews could be disregarded, and the proper approach was to consider them in the round having regard to the overall picture that emerged from all the material.
o As regards BKR’s decision to set up the Trust, although she did not completely lack the ability to understand the information relevant to this decision, she was unable to provide reasons for setting up the Trust, and the decision appeared to have been impelled by a paranoid belief that her son CK would have come after her money had she not set up the Trust. What this meant was that BKR lacked the ability to use and weigh the information relevant to her decision to set up the Trust.
o As regards BKR’s apparent decision to transfer assets from two banks to a third bank, her inability to recall previous inconsistent instructions constituted a failure of her ability to retain information relevant to this decision. Moreover, she was unable to explain why she wanted to make such a transfer, and this pointed to a lack of ability to use and weigh the relevant information.
o Drawing together the threads of the analysis, the conclusion was that BKR lacked the ability to make the decision to set up the Trust as well as to transfer her assets between banks. This inability was caused by a combination of her mental impairment and the circumstances in which she lived. Accordingly, the statutory test for lack of capacity under the MCA was met in her case, and the consequence was that her decisions to set up the Trust and transfer her assets had to be set aside, and deputies appointed to make decisions on her behalf.
o Observation: cases involving questions of mental capacity under the MCA might be better dealt with in a more inquisitorial and less adversarial mode, ie, with the court directing the inquiry, assisted by an assessor if need be. In particular, it would be sensible for the court to direct parties on the evidence, especially expert evidence, that it requires in order to reach its decision. Also, in any inquiry into a person’s mental capacity, she should be independently examined in consultation with her own doctor rather than have her capacity assessed under cross-examination, and the court ought to appoint the independent expert should parties be unable to agree on the appointment of the expert.
- Re Will of Loke Soh Lui [1997] 3 SLR(R) 956
o Loh died testate, but a need for clarification arose with regards to her will, because her lawful son predeceased her, and this required considering whether section 26 of the Wills Act was applicable to save the gifts under those clauses for her son’s issue.
o Section 26 of the Wills Act did not apply to class gifts. Nor would it apply to cases where a testator had clearly demonstrated his intention that the predeceasing of named beneficiaries would cause the testamentary gift to lapse.
o Clause 4 of the testatrix’s will made a gift to the class of “natural and lawful sons” of the testatrix since it did not name any particular sons by name or as individuals. This conclusion was reinforced by the lack of any express provision for a gift over. In consequence, the class closed on the date of the death of the testatrix and only those natural and lawful sons living at that date were entitled to the bequest under clause 4.
o Clause 7 made a gift to specifically-named individual sons as well as the testatrix’s daughter, and not to a class. It was not shown that the testatrix had not intended there to be a gift over. Therefore, section 26 of the Wills Act applied to prevent the gift to Chua Boon Unn from lapsing.
o Clause 8, however, specifically provided that any residuary estate was to be divided equally amongst the testatrix’s children or such of them as might survive her. The specific inclusion of these words demonstrated that the testatrix intended for the gift under that clause to lapse should any of the named beneficiaries predecease her. Section 26 was therefore inapplicable.
- Lian Kok Hong v Lian Bee Leng [2016] 3 SLR 405
o Dispute between the appellant and respondents as to which will was the last executed by the testator.
o Suspicious circumstances which rebutted the presumption that the testator knew and approved the contents of the will he or she had signed included only those circumstances which attended, or were at least relevant, to the preparation and execution of the will itself.
o On the facts, there were suspicious circumstances which were sufficient to prevent the operation of the presumption reversing the evidential burden of showing the Testator knew and approved of the contents of the August 2012 Will.
o The standard of proof required to show that the testator knew and/or approved of the contents of a will was that of a balance of probabilities. The lightness or gravity of the suspicions aroused by the circumstances determined the amount of evidence required to dispel the suspicions. The suspicion could be slight and easily dispelled or it could be so grave that it could hardly be removed.
o It was not the law that reading or even explaining the terms of a will to a testator was a mandatory requirement. It was no doubt the best way to show that the testator understood the terms of the will (assuming he had testamentary capacity and his mind was not unduly influenced by some party or event). On the facts and in the light of the Judge’s unappealed findings, it was shown on a balance of probabilities that the Testator knew and approved of the contents of the will. Even if the Judge had made a finding on the evidence that the Testator had forgotten that he purported to revoke the 10 June 2012 Will, the fact that the Testator read and signed the August 2012 Will, after signing against the amendments, was sufficient on a balance of probabilities, to give rise to an inference that the Testator knew and approved what he was signing.
- UAM v UAN [2018] 4 SLR 1086
o Plaintiff was one of five tenants-in-common of a bungalow along side his father, mother, older brother and older sister. The brother and the first defendant (“1st defendant”), who was the brother’s wife, were appointed as co-executors by the mother in a will in 1980 (“the 1980 Will”). The second defendant (“2nd defendant”), a son of the brother, was the sole beneficiary under the 1980 Will. The father similarly appointed the brother and 1st defendant as co-executors, and devised his one-fifth share of the Property to the 2nd defendant’s elder brother.
o According to the plaintiff, the mother executed a later will in 1981 (“the 1981 Will”), which appointed the plaintiff as the sole executor of the mother’s estate and devised her one-fifth share in the Property to the plaintiff absolutely. Subsequently, the father and mother passed away. The only asset in the mother’s estate was her one-fifth share of the Property. The petition for probate of the 1980 Will was filed and probate was extracted on 10 December 1990 and a limited grant of probate in respect of the 1980 Will was obtained by the brother. The brother then passed away in 2006.
o In the present suit, the plaintiff sought the revocation of the grant of probate issued based on the 1980 Will, a pronouncement against the validity of the 1980 Will and a pronouncement in solemn form for the 1981 Will. The defendants counterclaimed to pronounce against the validity of the 1981 Will, hold the 1980 Will valid and admit the original will into probate.
o The plaintiff’s present action amounted to an abuse of process because the issues of the validity of the 1980 Will and the 1981 Will ought to have been raised in the previous proceedings. There was more than ample opportunity for the plaintiff to have presented his case as to why he had proprietary interest in the Property in those proceedings. There were no new facts or fresh evidence and all the relevant circumstances pertaining to the preparation of the 1980 Will and the 1981 Will remained unchanged. The reality of the present action was that the plaintiff was effectively seeking the same proprietary interest in the Property as in the previous proceedings, just that he was now doing so based on a different legal basis. The plaintiff had also acted unreasonably in bringing the present proceedings as it relied on inconsistent claims from those brought in previous proceedings. His vexatious conduct was further apparent from the fact that he was aware of the existence of the 1981 Will at all times but only chose to invoke it much later after failing in his previous attempts to claim beneficial ownership over the Property. The plaintiff’s prejudicial delay, the absence of fresh evidence and the advancement of inconsistent arguments in the previous proceedings reflected precisely the kind of abuse that the extended doctrine of res judicata was designed to prevent.
o The plaintiff had asserted inconsistent ownership rights or interests over the same Property in separate proceedings. In the previous proceedings, he asserted that he had beneficial ownership over the Property while in the present suit, he claimed an interest in the Property through the 1981 Will. These were inconsistent because the mother could not possibly have had full ownership over her share of the Property that she could bequeath to the plaintiff in the 1981 Will while the plaintiff had beneficial ownership over that same share. The plaintiff had nevertheless not waived his right to assert the validity of the 1981 Will because he did not have available to him two inconsistent set of rights (the claim of beneficial ownership was not a right that he had at the material time) to exercise at the material time.
o The doctrine of approbation and reprobation, which was a variant of election, did not apply for the same reasons as the argument on waiver by election.
o The plaintiff did not discharge his burden of proving that the 1981 Will was valid. The rebuttable presumption that the mother knew and approved the contents of the 1981 Will did not arise because there were highly suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the will. The plaintiff, who clearly obtained a substantial benefit from the 1981 Will as the sole named beneficiary, had brought the mother to meet with lawyers concerning the will on two occasions, with the mother executing two other legal documents, one of which was patently inconsistent with the 1981 Will. Additionally, the plaintiff was, during that relevant period, taking steps to have his family members transfer their respective shares of the Property to him. Against the context of the plaintiff being such an interested party, it was highly suspicious when the plaintiff played such a pivotal role in the execution of the 1981 Will.
o Without the presumption of testamentary capacity, the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the mother knew and approved the contents of the 1981 Will. Although it was usually likely that a will that is professionally prepared by a solicitor, duly executed and read over to the testator before signing represented the testator’s instructions, the unusual circumstances of an inconsistent document signed two weeks earlier called into question whether the mother truly knew and approved the contents of the 1981 Will. The plaintiff thus had to adduce further evidence as affirmative proof that the mother knew and approved of the contents of the 1981 Will. The plaintiff failed to meet this evidential burden. The plaintiff’s argument that his close relationship with his mother explained why the mother wanted to bequeath her share of the Property to him was not persuasive: while a close relationship could explain why the mother might want to benefit the plaintiff, it was insufficient, in and of itself, in the present circumstances to show that she intended to do so. In the circumstances, while the mother might have had some general intention to go along with his plans, it was unlikely that she had the specific testamentary intention to do so.
o The question of whether the doctrine of laches could apply to probate proceedings was open to argument. Several Canadian and Australian authorities suggested that the defence of laches could be applied to probate proceedings. This point was however not argued by the parties and hence not relied upon. If the defence of laches were indeed available, it would be unconscionable to allow the plaintiff to pursue his claim based on the length of the delay and of the plaintiff’s inaction in pronouncing the 1981 Will that he had since the demise of the mother in 1986. The delay here greatly prejudiced the defendants in their ability to defend the claim by depriving the defendants of direct evidence of the witnesses with personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the execution of both wills.
- ULV v ULW [2019] 3 SLR 1270
o The parties to the appeal were brothers. They had three other siblings. Their mother, T, passed away in 2016, having executed two wills, one in 2004 and one in 2008 (“the 2004 Will” and “the 2008 Will” respectively). The appellant propounded the 2008 Will and the respondent propounded the 2004 Will. The validity of the 2004 Will was undisputed; the only question was whether it had been revoked by the 2008 Will.
o There was insufficient evidence that T lacked testamentary capacity. Mere bodily ill-health and imperfect memory were not sufficient to vitiate testamentary capacity. Though T had purportedly told two of her children that the appellant had asked her to sign a document which she did not understand, it was not clear that T was referring to the 2008 Will. Other evidence showed that she was lucid well after the execution of the 2008 Will.
o Given that T had testamentary capacity at the time of making the 2008 Will, she was also presumed to have known and approved of its contents. There were no suspicious circumstances to displace attending or relating to the execution of the will that displaced this presumption. The appellant’s presence at the time the 2008 Will was prepared and signed was not sufficient to constitute a suspicious circumstance; it had to be shown that he had somehow influenced the contents of the will, for example by suggesting terms to T or instructing the solicitor who prepared the will.
o The presumption of knowledge and approval had been rebutted on the evidence for two main reasons. The first was that the provisions of the 2008 Will were on their face contradictory and the evidence did not show that they had been explained to, understood by and approved by T. Clauses 3 and 4 of the will made it sound as though the Flat was a conditional gift. However, the Flat was then included in the residuary clause, which meant that the appellant would acquire the Flat even if the condition was unmet. That would be a perverse outcome, since it removed any incentive for the appellant to comply with T’s wishes. It was very doubtful that this was what T intended. It was also doubtful that these provisions had been explained to T in sufficient detail or clarity so as to enable her to understand and approve them.
o The presumption of knowledge and approval was also rebutted for a second reason, namely, that T’s conduct towards the appellant and her conversations with other family members suggested that she did not fully grasp the provisions of the 2008 Will, in particular that the appellant would inherit the Flat upon her death. T harboured profound resentment and animosity towards the appellant, appeared anxious to prevent him from acquiring the Flat, and made various attempts to ensure that he would not do so. Taken together, these factors suggested that had T properly understood the effect of the 2008 Will, she would have revoked or amended it. The evidence showed that T did not mean to bequeath the Flat on the appellant and did not realise that she had done so.
o Undue influence could not be presumed in the context of a will. This was supported by local jurisprudence and by academic authority. The test for undue influence was a high one and required coercion overpowering the testator’s volition. There was no evidence to show that T was unduly influenced in this sense.
o The submission that the 2008 Will was void due to illegality was fanciful and should be rejected. There was not a shred of evidence that this motive had played on T’s mind at the time she made the 2008 Will.
- Yeo Henry (executor and trustee of the estate of Ng Lay Hua, deceased) v Yeo Charles [2016] SGHC 220
o [91] – [104]: 
* “In my view, Dr Ngui’s evidence in that regard falls far short of providing a basis for challenging Mdm Ng’s testamentary capacity. My reasons are as follows:
(a)     It was, as Ms Barker submitted, mere conjecture on Dr Ngui’s part.
(b)     It presupposed, as Dr Ngui admitted, that Mdm Ng did not review her testamentary gifts when she executed the 2012 Will. However, that assumption could not stand in the light of Pauline Ang’s attendance notes and evidence.
(c)     Most important of all, in the light of the evidence as to her improved mood, it could not be said that at the time of execution of the 2012 Will, Mdm Ng suffered from a state of depression so severe that it left her without the mental energy to make any decisions of her own as to whom to benefit.
It is also significant that the provisions of the Wills were consistent with Mdm Ng’s many utterances as to her testamentary intentions.”
* Coming back to the question whether she told Wee Yong that Mdm Ng used to threaten them as aforesaid, if she was unaware that Mdm Ng had said so, her answer to Mr Raman’s question would obviously have had to be “No”. How could she possibly have told Wee Yong that Mdm Ng had threatened so when she herself was unaware of the fact? Thus her answer, that she did not recall having told Wee Yong, suggests to me that she was aware that Mdm Ng had in fact made the statement.
* John deposed that while he was staying with his grandmother between 2004 and 2009, more than once she had told him that she would leave 64 Sian Tuan Avenue to him after she passed away. In particular, he recalled that after his marriage, Mdm Ng had “randomly mentioned that my wife and I should both move in to stay with her, telling me that ‘[the Sian Tuan House] is yours anyway, it’s only right that you stay here.’” In court, he placed the time this happened at perhaps the end of 2009 or early 2010.
* There are several difficulties with his evidence in this regard and, in particular, with respect to this last incident. First, Mdm Ng had by then already removed John as a beneficiary under her 2009 Will which was executed on 26 May 2009. Did Mdm Ng lie to him or had she forgotten her 2009 Will? His evidence also conflicted with the foregoing evidence of many occasions when she had declared her testamentary intentions. Finally, it also contradicted his own unequivocal evidence that after 2006 he and Mdm Ng had effectively stopped communicating and that there was no rational interaction between them. On balance, I did not consider John’s evidence as recounted in [103] above reliable.
Non-Muslims comparative tableDying testate (with a valid will)Dying intestate (no will)1. Right to choose one’s beneficiaries and determine their legaciesTestator has a free hand; subject only to reasonable provisions for dependants (IFPA)Succession to estate is determined by the provisions of the Intestate Succession Act; Estate may be inherited by persons undeserving or even by the State in the instance of bona vacantia2. Ability to choose the executor and Trustee of one’s will and set the terms of appointmentTestator can choose the executors and trustees of the Will and set the scope of their powers.

The Executor need not be a next-of-kin or a beneficiary; it may be a professional or trust company, and if the will is valid, this choice is always given effect by the Court.

While the Bankruptcy Act Section 130(1) disqualifies a bankrupt from being appointed or acting as a personal representative without the Court’s leave, the Court is likely to allow a bankrupt named as executor to take up the appointment to give effect to the testator’s choice.Only the next-of-kin who qualify under section 18(3) of the Probate and Administration Act can be the administrators; this could lead to a dispute as to which next-of-kin should be appointed as the administrator.

A bankrupt is very unlikely to be given leave to be appointed as an administrator, save for the limited exception for trustees of land settlement found at section 18(2) of the Probate and Administration Act.3. Minimum number of executors or personal representatives to administer an estate with a beneficiary who is a minorOnly one (1) executor is required.At least two (2) administrators must be appointed. This could lead to additional inconvenience as the administrators have to act jointly and difficulty in finding the additional administrator willing to be appointed. 
If there is a beneficiary minor, then regardless of the value of the estate, sureties are needed.4. Vesting of the deceased’s estate
(Teo Gim Tiong v Krisnasamy Pushpavathi [2014] 4 SLR 15)Vests in the executors upon death enabling the executor to handle deceased's affairs subject to production of probate if and
when required.Does not vest in the administrators until after letters of administration have been obtained Will vest in the Public Trustee in Singapore for purely statutory and formal purposes until a Grant is obtained by the
Administrator
The Estate will be in a state of limbo until a Grant of LA is obtained by the Administrator.5. Power to carry on the deceased's affairs and calling in of the deceased’s assetsExecutors have the power from the time the Deceased dies, to carry on the deceased’s affairs and call in the assets (subject to the validations of their actions by extraction of probate of the will, and any restrictions contained in the will).The intending administrators have no such power until they obtain the grant of LA.
Administrators cannot give good discharge for any payments that they collect until and unless a grant of LA has been obtained.6. Appointment of Guardians for infant children (sections 6 and 7 of the Guardianship of Infants Act)A Testator who has infant children can appoint testamentary guardians for the children The Testator has free choice to appoint a testamentary guardian, and that guardian appointed under the will of the deceased parent shall act jointly with the surviving parent of the infant so long as the other parent
remains alive, unless that parent objects to his so acting (Section 7(3) Guardianship of Infants Act)
If the surviving parent objects, the testamentary guardian can apply to court for orders to be made under Section 7(4).Where a person has died intestate, leaving children and the other parent of the children
surviving him, the surviving parent is the sole guardian, regardless of how the deceased
parent may have thought of the ability and suitability of the surviving parent to be the sole
guardian
If both parents have died without a will, there may be disputes between the next of kin of both parents to be appointed guardians (and thereby control the finances of the estates of
the deceased parents.7. Administration Bond/ Sureties to the Administration BondNone required, since the deceased was the one who appointed the Executor.All Family Division of the High Court LA applications require the Administrator to execute an Administration Bond and to provide 2 sureties (unless otherwise ordered by the
Court)
For the Family Courts, if the
circumstances of the Estate falls within certain classes as set out
in the Family Courts (para 68 of the FJCPD), Admin Bond and 2 sureties also needed, to guarantee the Administrators’ proper performance of the administration. The amount to be secured is the gross value of the estate.
It can cost hardship and embarrassment to the Administrator to have to ask around for people to volunteer to be sureties.
Application for dispensation of sureties will add to the costs of the matter. Time, cost and delay involved in extracting grant.8. Shorter time and cheaper to obtain probate as compared to Letter of AdministrationThe grant of probate can be obtained faster and at lower expense for legal costs and court filing fees if there is a valid will.Even in the most straightforward of cases (and even if sureties and administration bonds are not required), it is slower and
more costly to apply for a grant of LA as opposed to grant of probate. More documents have to be filed for a LA application than for a probate application.9. Need to prove deceased's religion, custom, personal law and ages and share entitlement of the beneficiaries.No such requirement in generalThese have to be proved and causes delay in extracting grant of letters of administration, and this is exacerbated for deceased who have a foreign domicile, as the Court will require an Affidavit of Foreign Law by a
foreign lawyer.10. Chain of executorshipIf, AFTER OBTAINING THE GRANT OF PROBATE, the executor dies without having completed the administration of T’s estate, an executor of the executor’s will (if any) steps into the latter’s shoes and continues with the administration of the estate (s25 Civil Law Act)No equivalent in intestate estates administration, and the beneficiaries will have to apply for a grant de bonis non, a fresh application to court.11. Preservation of family wealthA testator can stipulate that part or the whole of the family wealth is to be preserved subject to the rule against perpetuities and accumulations, for a period of time. This would ensure that the family wealth is not squandered by heirs.Without a will, the beneficiaries are entitled absolutely to receive their full entitlement under the ISA once all the estate has been collected in and debts paid. The administrator has no power to delay the distribution, since he would be in breach of fiduciary duties if he does so.12. Savings on stamp dutyThere is no stamp duty payable for the transfer by assent of a devised property to the named beneficiary, resulting in very substantial savings in stamp duty.The transfer by intestate succession may result in beneficiaries, having to execute a subsequent Deed of Arrangement in order to redistribute the estate according to the deceased’s wishes. This will result in ad valorem stamp duty if the transfer of immovable property is involved.13. Savings of Court FeesWhere there is a Will, there is no need to enter into an administration bond or to apply for dispensation of sureties. Besides, fewer documents need to be filed. There are filing fee savings on the Bond, application for dispensation and affidavit in support or other documents which may be required to be filed.More documents have to be filed for a grant of Letter of Administration. Under e-litigation, a filing fee is payable for the filing of every document, and this includes the filing of the annexed Letter of Administraion.14. Issuing good receipt and discharge in satisfaction of the deceased’s assetsIf executors are named in the will, or if any one of them gives any such discharge or receipt, this is sufficient, and can be done even before probate is extracted.No valid receipt or discharge may be given by an administrator unless he has extracted grant of letters of administration. Third parties are thus unwilling to deal with administrators unless they are able to produce the grant.15. Remuneration of the personal representativeThe testator can set and fix the remuneration of the Executor (though in the absence of an express stipulation in the will, section 66 of the PAA will apply)The personal representative can apply to the Court for commission under Section 66 of the Probate and Administration Act. This rate of commission may be as high as 5% of the value of the assets collected.In spite of the above, some people choose not to make a will because they cannot decide how their estates should be distributed and they are happy for the Intestate Succession Act to apply to their estate. In light of the advantages of testacy mentioned above, such clients should still be strongly encouraged to make a will so that there is an executor who will carry out their wish that the distribution of the estate is to follow the ISA In this way, they can enjoy the best of both worlds!
Obtaining a grant of representation
Main types of grant
- Grant of probate (testacy)
- Grant of letters of administration (intestacy)
- Grant of letters of administration with will annexed (Section 13 PAA)
- Resealing of grant of representation by a Commonwealth/Hong Kong Court
o Sections 47 and 49 PAA, Rule 953 FJR and paragraph 65 Family Justice Court Practice Directions (can reseal and thereafter have the same force and effect as if granted by SG court, but need pay security)
Probate Jurisdiction of Family Justice Courts (Family Division of the High Court and the Family Court)
- Value of deceased’s estate (Section 2(a) Family Justice (Family Proceedings before Family Division of High Court) Order 2014)
o any proceedings for a grant of probate or letters of administration in respect of the estate and effects of a deceased person, where the estate and effects in respect of which the grant is applied for, excluding what the deceased was possessed of or entitled to as a trustee and not beneficially, but without deducting anything on account of the debts due or owing from the deceased, are believed, at the time of commencement of those proceedings, by the plaintiff or applicant to exceed $5 million in value
- Deceased died domiciled outside Singapore
o Rule 227 FJR
* Application can be made to the Registrar for a grant or a probate of any will which is admissible to proof to the executor named in the will for English rules, or persons whom the will describes the duties in terms sufficient to constitute him as an executor according to the tenor of the will. 
* If the whole of the Singapore estate consists of immovable property, a grant limited to that immovable property may be made in accordance with the law which would have been applicable if the deceased had died domiciled in Singapore.
Non-contentious applications
Entitlement to Grant
- Testacy - executors named in the will. Where there is failure of executors, see Sections 13 and 14 PAA and Rule 219 FJR
o Section 13
* Letters of administration may be granted to such persons in the following order
* a universal or residuary legatee;
* a legal personal representative of a deceased universal or residuary legatee;
* such person or persons, being beneficiaries under the will, as would have been entitled to a grant of letters of administration if the deceased had died intestate;
* a legatee having a beneficial interest;
* a creditor of the deceased.
o Section 14
* Where an executor appointed by a will is absent from Singapore, and there is no other executor within Singapore willing to act, letters of administration with the will annexed may be granted to a duly authorised attorney of the absent executor, limited until he obtains probate for himself, and in the meantime to any purpose to which the attorney’s authority is limited.
o Rule 219
* The person or persons entitled to a grant of probate or administration with the will annexed must be determined in accordance with sections 8 and 13.
- Clearing off prior rights – When are renunciations and consents required?
o In the Estate of Tan Hui Cheng also known as Tan Hui Cheng Lily, deceased [1993] SGHC 106
* In my judgment the court's duty is to have regard to the rights of all persons interested in the estate of the deceased. A grant may be made to any person entitled in the same degree. On the facts of this case it was not necessary for a renunciation of Pang Pei Hsien to accompany the petition. I allowed the appeal and granted the letters of administration.
o Toh Seok Kheng v Huang Huiqun [2011] 1 SLR 737
* Although where a person dies intestate the court had a discretion as to whom to appoint as the administrator of the deceased’s estate, the starting point was that the person who was most suitable among the beneficiaries to be the administrator was determined according to the priorities of entitlement to the deceased’s estate under the laws of intestate succession because the beneficiary with the greatest entitlement to the deceased’s estate would naturally be the person most interested in the deceased’s estate. Hence, the defendant, being the deceased’s surviving spouse, had priority over the plaintiff, who was the deceased’s parent, in obtaining a grant of letters of administration of the estate.
* The application to be made the sole administrator of the estate was also wrong procedurally because a contentious action for the grant of letters of administration was a “probate action” within the definition of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) O 72 r 1(2). Hence, the procedural rules which regulated probate actions had to be observed. The procedural rules required a probate action to be begun by writ, and the adoption of the wrong procedure was a “fairly serious error” that would justify a striking out if such an application was made. It was thus an abuse of process for the plaintiff to apply in an originating summons for a declaration to be made the sole administrator of the estate in the face of a known contesting applicant for letters of administration.
o Sections 3 and 5 PAA, Rule 224 FJR, and Form 53 FJCPD
* Section 3: Any person who is or may become entitled to any probate or letters of administration may expressly renounce his right to such grant.
* Orally by the person or by his advocate and solicitor, on the hearing of any probate application or probate action
* In writing signed by the person so renouncing and attested either by an advocate and solicitor or by any person before whom an affidavit may be sworn
* Section 5: The renunciation, whether made expressly in the manner provided by section 3, or constructively in the manner provided by section 4, shall preclude the person so renouncing from applying thereafter for probate or letters of administration.
* The court may at any time allow the person so renouncing to withdraw his renunciation for the purpose of taking a grant, if it is shown that the withdrawal is for the benefit of the estate or of those interested under the will or intestacy.
* Rule 224:
* A grant may be made to any person entitled to the grant without notice to other persons entitled in the same degree.
* A dispute between persons entitled to a grant in the same degree must be brought by summons before the Registrar.
* Unless the Registrar otherwise directs, administration must be granted to a living person in preference to the personal representative of a deceased person who would, if living, be entitled in the same degree and to a person not under disability in preference to an infant entitled in the same degree.
* If the issue of a summons under this rule is known to the Registrar, he must not allow any grant to be extracted until such summons is finally disposed of.
o Section 18 PAA – Clearing off of rights of deceased beneficiaries
* In granting such letters of administration the court shall have regard to the rights of all persons interested in the estate of the deceased person or the proceeds of sale thereof, and in regard to land settled previously to the death of the deceased, letters of administration may be granted to the trustees of the settlement.
* Any such grant of letters of administration may be limited in any way the court thinks fit.
* Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) —
* (a)	letters of administration may be granted to the husband or widow or next of kin or any of them;
* (b)	when such persons apply for letters of administration, it shall be in the discretion of the court to grant them to any one or more of such persons;
* (c)	when no such person applies, letters of administration may be granted to a creditor of the deceased; and
* (d)	in any case where —
o (i)	the next of kin of any person dying intestate, or the greater number of such next of kin, so desire; or
o (ii)	no next of kin or creditor or other person appears and makes out a claim to letters of administration,
letters of administration of the estate and effects of the intestate may be granted by the court to such person as the court thinks fit for the purpose.
* Nothing in this section shall affect any law by which special provision is made regarding the estates of persons of a particular religion or race.
- Procedural Steps to be complied with for the filing of the application for Grant (Rules 208 and 209 FJR, and Paragraphs 62 to 69 FJCPD)

o Take note of electronic checklist which will be generated upon filing and will indicate status of documents filed
- Procedural steps after filing of the application:
o Supporting Affidavit of personal representative (Rule 208 FJR, Paragraph 63 FJCPD)
o (ii) Administration Oath (Section 28 PAA)
* Upon the grant of any probate or letters of administration, the grantee shall take an oath in the prescribed form, faithfully to administer the estate and to account for the same.
* (2)  Subsection (1) shall not apply where the grantee is the Public Trustee or a trust company.
o (iii) Schedule of Assets
* Schedule of assets will be filed on a “to the best of the applicant’s knowledge at that time” basis. The applicant will provide an undertaking to amend the schedule when further information is obtained on the assets. Leave is not required to amend the schedule of assets. The amended schedule can be filed with an affidavit to explain what is being amended and to verify the amended schedule
- Delay in applying for grant (i.e., if grant is filed more than 6 months after death of the deceased)
o (i) Rule 208(8) FJR
* Where an application for a grant is, for the first time, made after the lapse of 6 months from the deceased’s death, the Statement in Form 51 must set out the reason for the delay in making the application.
- Additional Requirements (Rules 208 and 209 FJR, Paragraphs 62 to 67 FJPCD):
o (i) Deceased’s aliases
* the applicant must state in the Statement in Form 51 —
* the true name of the deceased; and
* that some part of the estate, specifying it, was held in the other name, or as to any other reason that there may be for the inclusion of the other name in the grant.
o (ii) If will is not executed in English language
o (iii) If death certificate or other documents are not in English language
o (iv) Affidavit of Due Execution
o (v) Affidavit of Foreign Law
- Further steps before extraction of Grant:
o For letters of administration, consider whether administration bond is required, and if so, what are the requirements regarding sureties to the administration Bond (Section 29 PAA, Paragraph 68 FJCPD)
* A grantee of letters of administration, whether with or without a Will annexed, from a Family Court shall give security for the due administration of the estate by way of an administration bond and 2 sureties in the following circumstances:
* where the estate and effects in respect of which the grant is applied for, exclusive of what the deceased was possessed of or entitled to as a trustee and not beneficially, but without deducting anything on account of the debts due or owing from the deceased, exceed the value of $5 million;
* where there is a minority interest in the estate;
* where there is a life interest in the estate;
* where there are beneficiaries who lack capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap. 177A);
* where the grantee is a creditor; and
* in such other cases as the Registrar thinks fit.
* Sureties must not use protected property under section 51 of the Housing and Development Act (Cap. 129) for the purpose of justification.
o Consider the requirements if an application for dispensation of sureties is required (Section 29(3) PAA, Paragraph 69 FJCPD)
* The court or the registrar may for any sufficient reason increase or decrease the number of the sureties, or dispense with them, or reduce the amount of the bond.
Contentious Applications
- Probate actions (Rule 252(1) FJR)
o In these Rules, “probate action” means an action for the grant of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, of a deceased person or for the revocation of such a grant or for a decree pronouncing for or against the validity of an alleged will, not being an action which is non?contentious.
- Commencement of probate actions and procedure
o Caveats
* Function and effect of caveats; Section 33 PAA, and Rules 239(1) and 242 FJR
* Any person having or claiming to have interest may, at any time after the death of a deceased person and before probate or letters of administration have been granted to his estate, enter a general caveat, so that no probate or letters of administration shall be granted without notice to the caveator.
* After entry of any such caveat no such grant shall be made until the caveator has been given opportunity to contest the right of any probate applicant to a grant.
* Any person may, at any time after the death of a deceased person and before probate or letters of administration have been granted to his estate, enter a caveat if he wishes to —
o (a)	ensure that no grant is made without notice to the person; and
o (b)	be given an opportunity to contest the right to a grant.
* any caveat in force at the commencement of proceedings by way of citation shall, unless withdrawn pursuant to rule 239(9), remain in force until an application for a grant is made by the person shown to be entitled to the grant by the decision of the Court in such proceedings, and upon such application any caveat entered by a party who had notice of the proceedings shall cease to have effect;
* any caveat in respect of which a summons for directions has been issued shall remain in force until the commencement of a probate action or the making of an order for the caveat to cease to have effect; and
* the commencement of a probate action shall, whether or not any caveat has been entered, operate to prevent the sealing of a grant (other than a grant under section 20) until application for a grant is made by the person shown to be entitled to the grant by the decision of the Court in such action, and upon such application any caveat entered by a party who had notice of the action, or by a caveator who was given notice under rule 241, shall cease to have effect.
* Procedure: entry of caveats, warnings to caveats, appearance to Warnings, summons process, disposal in a summary manner; rule 239 to 242 FJR
* Expiry of caveat (Rule 239(3) FJR)
* Except as otherwise provided by this Division, a caveat shall remain in force for 6 months from the date on which it is entered and shall then cease to have effect, without prejudice to the entry of a further caveat or caveats.
o Citations
* Function of citations and pre-conditions
* Note: the citor must enter a caveat before issuing a citation (Rule 243(4) FJR)
* Rules 243 to 245 FJR
* A citation to accept or refuse a grant may be issued at the instance of any person who would himself be entitled to a grant in the event of the person cited renouncing his right to the grant.
* A citation to propound a will must be directed to the executors named in the will and to all persons interested under the will, and may be issued at the instance of any citor having an interest contrary to that of the executors or such other persons.
* Rules 256, 258 and 259 FJR
* On the application of the plaintiff, or of any other party who has pleaded in a probate action, a citation may be issued against any person not a party to the action who has an adverse interest to the applicant notifying him that if he does not enter an appearance judgment may be given in the action without further notice to him.
* In an action for the revocation of the grant of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, of a deceased person, a citation against the person to whom the probate or letters of administration, as the case may be, was or were granted requiring him to bring into and leave at the Registry the probate or letters of administration, as the case may be, may be issued on the plaintiff’s application.
* A citation under rule 256 or 258 must be issued out of the Registry and must be settled by the Court before it is issued.
o (2)  Before such a citation is issued, an affidavit verifying the statements of fact to be made in the citation must be sworn by the person applying for it to be issued.
o (3)  Despite paragraph (2), the Court may in special circumstances allow the affidavit to be sworn by that person’s solicitor.
o (4)  Issue of a citation takes place upon its being sealed by an officer of the Registry.
o (5)  Without prejudice to rule 901, a citation under rule 256 or 258 must be served personally on the person cited.
o (6)  Service out of the jurisdiction of a citation under rule 256 or 258 is permissible but, in the case of a citation under rule 258, only with the leave of the Court.
o (7)  Rule 312 applies in relation to an application for the grant of leave under paragraph (6).
o (8)  An order granting leave to serve a citation under rule 258 out of the jurisdiction must limit a time within which the person to be served with the citation must comply.
o (9)  Rules 313, 314 and 315 apply in relation to a citation under rule 258 as they apply in relation to a writ.
o Probate action must be begun by writ
* Rules 17(2)(b) and 253 FJR
* Without prejudice to the generality of these Rules, the following proceedings must be begun by writ:
o (a)	proceedings for divorce under Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)
* Jigarlal Kantilal Doshi v Damayanti Kantilal Doshi [1997] 2 SLR(R) 167 at [21]
* These rules as set out in the Rules of Court clearly required an action of the sort that the plaintiffs had taken out to be begun by writ in accordance with O 72. Furthermore, under O 5 r 5, a party may proceed by way of an originating motion “if, but only if, by these Rules or by any written law the proceedings in question are required or authorised to be so begun”. I agree with Mr Manjit Singh that the wrong procedure was adopted. It is a fairly serious error and one which would have justified the defendants striking it out if such an application had been made in the first instance. However, as counsel for the defendants elected to oppose the motion on the merits no application was made to strike out the motion. Since no prejudice was occasioned to either party, I decided to hear the application on its merits.
* Toh Seok Kheng v Huang Huiqun [2011] 1 SLR 737 at [26]
* The plaintiff’s application to be made the sole administrator of the estate was also wrong procedurally. If the plaintiff wished to bring an interest action to contest the suitability of the defendant to be the administrator despite the defendant’s prior right, she was of course free to do so. However, a contentious action for the grant of letters of administration is a “probate action” within the definition of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) O 72 r 1(2). As such, the procedural rules under O 72 which regulate probate actions must be observed… It was thus an abuse of process for the plaintiff to apply in an originating summons for a declaration to be made the sole administrator of the estate in the face of a known contesting applicant for letters of administration. The third prayer of the application was therefore dismissed.
o Entry of appearance and filing of pleadings
* Rules 261 to 265 FJR
* Where any defendant to a probate action fails to enter an appearance, the plaintiff, upon filing an affidavit proving due service of the writ on that defendant may, after the time limited for appearing, proceed with the action as if that defendant had entered an appearance.
* Where the defendant, or all the defendants, to a probate action, fails or fail to enter an appearance, and none of the persons (if any) cited under rule 256 has entered an appearance, then, unless on the plaintiff’s application the Court orders the action to be discontinued, the plaintiff may after the time limited for appearing by the defendant apply to the Court for leave to set down the action for trial.
* The plaintiff in a probate action must, unless the Court gives leave to the contrary or a statement of claim is endorsed on the writ —
o (a)	serve a statement of claim on every defendant who enters an appearance in the action; and
o (b)	serve the statement of claim before the expiration of 6 weeks after entry of appearance by that defendant or of 8 days after the exchange of affidavits under rule 260, whichever is the later.
* Despite rule 349(1) and (2), a defendant to a probate action who alleges that he has any claim or is entitled to any relief or remedy in respect of any matter relating to the grant of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, of the deceased person which is the subject of the action must add to his defence a counterclaim in respect of that matter.
* A plaintiff in a probate action who disputes the interest of a defendant must allege in his statement of claim that he denies the interest of that defendant.
* In a probate action in which the interest by virtue of which a party claims to be entitled to a grant of letters of administration is disputed, the party disputing that interest must show in his pleading that if the allegations made in the pleadings are proved he would be entitled to an interest in the estate.
o Intervener in probate action
* Rule 260 FJR
* Unless the Court otherwise directs, the plaintiff and every defendant who has entered an appearance in a probate action must swear an affidavit —
o (a)	describing and exhibiting any testamentary script of the deceased person, whose estate is the subject of the action, of which he has any knowledge or, if such be the case, stating that he knows of no such script; and
o (b)	if any such script of which he has knowledge is not in his possession or under his control —
o (i)	giving the name and address of the person in whose possession or under whose control it is; or
o (ii)	stating that he does not know the name or address of that person, as the case may be.
* Seah Peng Koon (the trustees of the estate of Seah Liang Seah, deceased) v Seah Peng Song [1993] 1 SLR(R) 480 at [17]–[30]
* It is true that W in In re Lart had taken advantage of the judgment but the decision of the court did not rest on this fact but on the principle that in the probate division, where a will is in question, a party who has knowledge of the proceedings and has a right to intervene, does not intervene, is prima facie bound by the result of the proceedings. The fact that Seah Peng Song may not, in this case, have taken the benefit of Lai Kew Chai J’s judgment does not detract from the fact that he was aware of the proceedings before Lai Kew Chai J and had a right to intervene in those proceedings but chose not to intervene.
* Seah Peng Song knew of the proceedings before Lai Kew Chai J. He raised no issue on conflict, did not intervene and has been content for all these years to accept the decision of Lai Kew Chai J. The principles embodied in Young v Holloway and the other cases referred to above would, in our view, apply also to any challenge that Seah Peng Song now makes that the trustees of the estate of Seah Eng Thye were in a position of conflict and could not have represented his interests (even as derivative income beneficiary) in the proceedings before Lai Kew Chai J.
* For the above reasons, we are of the view that Seah Peng Song was estopped from challenging the validity of the ruling made by Lai Kew Chai J that the trustees were entitled to deduct 5% commission from the award and interest thereon made by the Collector of Land Revenue in respect of the acquisition of the Bendemeer estate.
o Joinder of parties and notice of proceedings
* All parties affected by the probate action should either be joined as parties or served with notice of the proceedings under Rule 362 FJR (Notice of Action)
o Discontinuance
* Rule 267 FJR
* At any stage of the proceedings in a probate action the Court may, on the application of the plaintiff or of any party who has entered an appearance —
o (a)	order the action to be discontinued on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks just; and
o (b)	further order that a grant of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, of the deceased person, as the case may be, which is the subject of the action be made to the person entitled to the grant.
o Administration pending trial
* Section 20 PAA
* Pending any probate action, letters of administration may be granted to such person as the court may appoint, limited so that the administrator shall not be empowered to distribute the estate, and shall be subject to such control by, and direction of, the court as the court thinks fit.
* Rule 271 FJR
* An application under section 20 of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap. 251) for the grant of administration may be made to the Registrar by originating summons.
* An administrator to whom a grant is made under section 20 of the Probate and Administration Act must at the time when he begins proceedings for taxation of his costs, or at such other time as the Registrar may direct, produce at the Registry an account (verified by affidavit) of the moneys and other property received or paid or otherwise dealt with by him in his capacity as such an administrator.
The Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) and Mental Capacity Issues
- Statutory principles
o Sections 3 and 6 of Mental Capacity Act 2008
* A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that the person lacks capacity.
* A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help the person to do so have been taken without success.
* A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because the person makes an unwise decision.
* An act done, or a decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in the person’s best interests.
* Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s rights and freedom of action.
* Consider —
* (a)	whether it is likely that the person will at some time have capacity in relation to the matter in question; and
* (b)	if it appears likely that the person will, when that is likely to be.
* So far as is reasonably practicable, permit and encourage the person to participate, or to improve the person’s ability to participate, as fully as possible in any act done for the person and any decision affecting the person.
* Where the determination relates to life-sustaining treatment, he or she must not, in considering whether the treatment is in the best interests of the person concerned, be motivated by a desire to bring about the death of the person concerned.
* Where the determination relates to the giving, refusal or revocation of —
* (a)	appropriate consent of the person concerned under the Human Biomedical Research Act 2015 — he or she must take into account such matters, considerations and procedures as may be prescribed under Part 3 of that Act
* Where the determination relates to the disposition or settlement of the person’s property, he or she must be motivated by a desire to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the person’s property is preserved for application towards the costs of the person’s maintenance during the person’s life.
* He or she must consider, so far as is reasonably ascertainable —
* (a)	the person’s past and present wishes and feelings (and, in particular, any relevant written statement made by the person when the person had capacity);
* (b)	the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his or her decision if the person had capacity; and
* (c)	the other factors that the person would be likely to consider if the person were able to do so.
* He or she must take into account, if it is practicable and appropriate to consult them, the views of —
* (a)	anyone named by the person as someone to be consulted on the matter in question or on matters of that kind;
* (b)	anyone engaged in caring for the person or interested in the person’s welfare;
* (c)	any one of a lasting power of attorney granted by the person; and
* (d)	any deputy appointed for the person by the court,
as to what would be in the person’s best interests and, in particular, as to the matters mentioned in subsection (8).
o Code of Practice and Section 41 of Mental Capacity Act
* To avoid doubt, any code of practice issued under this section is deemed not to be subsidiary legislation.
- Capacity
o Sections 4 and 5 of Mental Capacity Act
* For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time the person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.
* It does not matter whether the impairment or disturbance is permanent or temporary.
* Decided on a balance of probabilities
* For the purposes of section 4, a person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself if the person is unable —
* (a)	to understand the information relevant to the decision;
* (b)	to retain that information;
* (c)	to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or
* (d)	to communicate his or her decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any other means).
* A person is not to be regarded as unable to understand the information relevant to a decision if the person is able to understand an explanation of it given to him or her in a way that is appropriate to his or her circumstances (using simple language, visual aids or any other means).
* The fact that a person is able to retain the information relevant to a decision for a short period only does not prevent the person from being regarded as able to make the decision.
* The information relevant to a decision includes information about the reasonably foreseeable consequences of —
* (a)	deciding one way or another; or
* (b)	failing to make the decision.
o Re BKR [2015] 4 SLR 81
* As to the question of what BKR’s mental impairment was, this was something to be ascertained by considering her symptoms as demonstrated in the results of the cognitive tests administered to her as well as her performance in clinical interviews and under cross-examination. On that evidence, it was difficult to state with certainty whether she had dementia or MCI. But it was sufficient to conclude that BKR’s mental impairment was situated somewhere between MCI and dementia on the continuum on which they both existed, and that this impairment had caused a number of observable symptoms, namely, 
* (a) a significant decline in her memory, 
* (b) a less severe but observable deterioration in her executive functions, including and especially in her ability to understand information and to weigh countervailing considerations against one another, and 
* (c) the emergence of paranoid and false beliefs that could and did affect her actions
o Re TQR [2016] SGFC 98
* At [3]: “The starting point was section 24(9)(b) of the Mental Capacity Act (“MCA”) which permits Deputies to be given powers of investment in respect of P’s property.”
* At [22] – [23]: “On the other hand, a Deputy cannot base his decisions solely, or even mainly, on how this would impact the incapacitated person’s heirs in future.
While this could be a relevant consideration in the light of section 6(7) of the MCA which requires a Deputy to take into account matters which the incapacitated person would have considered, this factor remains subordinate to the need to preserve the incapacitated person’s assets for his future maintenance. The preservation of an incapacitated person’s assets for his future maintenance always remains the first priority.”
At [28] – [29]: “As such, if an incapacitated person has very little assets, this means that there is very little buffer if anything goes wrong and the court would therefore be slow to permit a Deputy to invest such an incapacitated person’s assets because of the risk of loss.
On the other hand, if an incapacitated person has significant assets that are more than sufficient for his needs, then the court may well be more willing to permit investment since such an incapacitated person would still have enough assets for his maintenance even if the investments resulted in significant losses and, unless there is evidence to the contrary, the court would be more willing to accept the argument that if the incapacitated person had mental capacity he would have wanted to invest his money rather than to leave it un-invested.”
o BUV v BUU [2020] 3 SLR 1041
* The test for capacity in section 4(1) of the MCA had a functional and clinical component. The functional aspect was that the subject had to be unable to make a decision, and the clinical aspect was that this inability had to be caused by a mental impairment. The functional component was a judgment for the court to make based on the evidence as to the degree the subject’s mental functioning was compromised. Answers in cross-examination should be considered in assessing the functional component, to shed light on whether the subject was able to retain, understand, use and weigh information relevant to decisions and her symptoms as might shed light on the nature of her mental impairment.
* The requirements under section 5(1) of the MCA, which defined the inability to make a decision, were to be read conjunctively. The court’s assessment as to mental capacity should be made holistically.
* Section 3(3) of the MCA stated that a person was not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help her do so have been unsuccessful. This allowed for the possibility of mental capacity being exercised with some assistance, but did not mean that any impairment could be sufficiently mitigated by assistance. There had to be a base level of capacity for the subject to recognise the shortcomings she might have. Read with section 5(2), any assistance was aimed at helping a person retain her existing decision-making capability.
o ULP v ULS [2021] 5 SLR 1291
* Although Dr Nagaendran’s clinical notes showed a decline in P’s “Mini-Mental State Examination” scores, this did not show that P lacked mental capacity to execute the LPA on 30 June 2015. There still had to be an assessment of P’s capacity at the material time, when she made the decision on the LPA.
* Unlike the Code, there was no provision in the MCA that required the court to take the Guidelines into account in MCA-related decisions, although it would, nonetheless, be sensible for doctors to comply with these Guidelines. While it would be prudent for doctors to keep contemporaneous, detailed records of their discussions with patients, including the questions that they had asked, the court did not agree with the appellants’ counsel that Dr Kua’s clinical notes had insufficient detail and contravened the Code. His clinical notes, though brief, were clear so far as the basis for his assessment was concerned.
* Since the court allowed the appeal based on the ground of undue pressure, it was not necessary for the court to make a finding on whether the respondent had engaged in conduct that was not in P’s best interests. That was an issue that was best ventilated in the application for a deputy for P.
o Goh Yng Yng Karen (executrix of the estate of Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong), deceased) v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin [2021] 3 SLR 896
* The test for mental capacity under s 4(1) of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MCA”) had a clinical and a functional component. In relation to the clinical component of the s 4(1) MCA test, a close examination of the expert evidence was required to determine if Mdm Liew had an impairment of mind. As for the functional component, an examination of all the evidence regarding Mdm Liew and her interactions with others was necessary to determine if she was likely to have been unable to make a decision for herself in relation to the POAs. The court’s assessment as to mental capacity should be made holistically.
* In other words, the issue was whether, from the evidence of her conduct leading to and surrounding the execution of the POAs, it was likely that she was able to understand the nature and effects of the POAs and thus able to make a decision for herself in relation to the execution of the POAs. The relevant circumstances suggested that Mdm Liew was not able to understand what she was signing.
- Acts and decisions covered by the Mental Capacity Act

* Must have litigation representative, but the Court may, on its own motion or on the application of any person (including P), permit P to conduct any proceedings under the Act without a litigation representative3, if the Court is of the opinion that P does not lack capacity to conduct those proceedings himself (regardless of whether P lacks capacity in relation to the matter or matters to which the proceedings relate).
* An application made to permit P to conduct mental capacity proceedings without a litigation representative must be supported by a medical report stating that P does not lack capacity to conduct proceedings himself.
* Third party intervention (TWD v UQE [2019] 3 SLR 662 at [56]–[84])
* Under rule 178(2) of the FJR, the court had a broad discretion to order that a person be joined as a party to proceedings under the MCA. In exercising its discretion, the court should consider the advantages and disadvantages of joinder on the facts of the case at hand to determine whether joinder was desirable. It was not strictly necessary that joinder would aid the court in dealing with the substantive application before the court. The advantages of joinder had to simply outweigh the disadvantages for joinder to be ordered.
* Where a deputy application was made in respect of a person (“X”), and the person who was or was alleged to be liable in tort to X applied to be joined to the application to adduce evidence on X’s capacity, it would generally not be desirable for the (alleged) tortfeasor to be joined as a party to the deputy application, because the disadvantages of joinder would generally outweigh its advantages. Joinder would inevitably delay the disposition of the deputy application and increase the related costs, would probably afford the (alleged) tortfeasor access to private and confidential information about X (and possibly X’s family), and would likely make the proceedings more adversarial. Further, joinder was not the only means by which the (alleged) tortfeasor might place relevant evidence regarding X’s capacity before the court. And although joinder would afford the court the opportunity of hearing submissions from the (alleged) tortfeasor, it was not obvious that such submissions would generally add significant value.
* Even if a MCA court’s finding that a person lacked capacity bound the world, such that the (alleged) tortfeasor was not entitled to dispute X’s status as a person who lacked capacity, it would still be open to the (alleged) tortfeasor to dispute, at least, the extent to which X lacked capacity. Thus, the (alleged) tortfeasor’s legal rights and financial interest would not be substantially affected by findings he had no opportunity to be heard on, because it was the substantive aspects in which X lacked capacity, rather than X’s bare status as a person who lacked capacity, that would determine the (alleged) tortfeasor’s liability (if any) to X, and the (alleged) tortfeasor would be entitled to be heard on those issues.
* Where the (alleged) tortfeasor sought to place evidence regarding X’s capacity before the court hearing the deputy application, the following procedure should apply:
o The (alleged) tortfeasor should write to the court to inform the court of the evidence in his possession. The letter should set out details regarding the nature of the evidence, and explain its relevance to the deputy application. The letter should also generally enclose a copy of the evidence. A copy of the letter and its enclosures should be sent to the applicant who had brought the deputy application.
o The applicant bringing the deputy application should then have the opportunity to respond to the (alleged) tortfeasor’s letter, by letter to the court. The applicant should state his position on the relevance of the evidence and whether he consented to the admission of the evidence. The applicant’s reply to the court should be copied to the (alleged) tortfeasor.
o The court should then consider whether the evidence was relevant to the issues to be determined in the deputy application. If the court was satisfied that the evidence was irrelevant, the court should inform the applicant and the (alleged) tortfeasor of this. The (alleged) tortfeasor might then seek to raise the evidence in the separate tort action (if any) brought by X against him. If the court was satisfied that the evidence might be relevant, then it might introduce the evidence into the deputy application of its own motion pursuant to rules 22(3)(b) and 22(3)(g) of the FJR. The court might then make consequential orders, eg, directing a court-appointed medical expert or the parties’ medical experts to provide further medical reports which addressed the new evidence.
* Vesting of property in person appointed outside Singapore (Section 23(4) read with Paragraph 7 of the Second Schedule to the MCA)
* Court has power to direct property or dividends from stocks to be vested in persons outside Singapore.
* Costs of proceeding (Rule 190 FJCPD)
* Court can order remuneration for discharging functions of LPA
o Powers of deputies
* Sections 22 and 23 MCA (Note the restrictions under Section 25 MCA)
* Cannot restrain person unless:
o in doing the act, the deputy is acting within the scope of an authority expressly conferred on the deputy by the court.
o P lacks, or the deputy reasonably believes that P lacks, capacity in relation to the matter in question.
o the deputy reasonably believes that it is necessary to do the act in order to prevent harm to P.
o the act is a proportionate response to —
* (a)	the likelihood of P’s suffering harm; or
* (b)	the seriousness of that harm.
Lecture notes 
What we will be tested on 
Will be tested on the timing of when things are supposed to happen, and the content of documents. 

Scenario 1
Father just passed away. He has a HDB flat in his sole name, insurance policies, and CPF money. He has several joint accounts with the mother. 
- Practical steps upon testator’s passing 
o Ask – is there a will? Death certificate? 
o Get list of assets. Required for application of grant. 
- Application for grant 
o Where there is a will and executor 
* Where there is a will and executor, then apply for grant of probate 
* Just produce will and death cert 
* Where there is a will or no executor (not named, all dead, or unwilling to act) – then apply for letter of administration 
* Application process more complex – think of who is the proper administrator, think about who can apply for letter of administration 
o Where there is no will
o Where there is already a grant 
* Where there is a foreign grant, do you apply for a fresh grant in Singapore, or apply to reseal the foreign grant? 
* Only reseal foreign grant where it’s 100% able to be (??something) by the SG courts 
- Assets 
o HDB flat
* Situations where the beneficiary of the HDB flat doesn’t qualify to own the flat – then no choice but to sell the flat and give the beneficiary the proceeds 
o Insurance policies 
o CPF monies 
* Not part of the estate. Covered by statutory regime under the CPF Act. 
* If there is a nomination made by the deceased in his lifetime, and it’s valid, CPF will write to the nominated beneficiary within a couple months, and then they will receive the money in their CPF 
* If no nominee, the CPF will give money to the Public Trustee to handle distribution. Then the beneficiaries (under intestate succession rules) must apply to the Public Trustee to have the assets distributed to them 
o Joint accounts 
* Note that the presumption of survivorship is not applicable in every country, not even every Commonwealth country. 
* There are situations where monies in the joint account is not meant for the survivor – e.g. resulting trusts, or where money goes back to the estate. 
* If it’s intended for the survivor, then don’t need to put this account into the schedule of assets. 
* Another question – do jointly-held accounts need to be put into the will? Advice: check with client what the intention is. If testator intends survivorship to apply, then state clearly in the will. Can have some if/else – e.g. if the joint owner dies first, then I will become sole owner of this account. When I die, this account goes to my daughter. 

Scenario 2 – testamentary capacity 
I have uncle who has early stage dementia, how to will? 
- Testamentary capacity – Chee Mu Lim (above) 
o Capacity to make a will 
* The old person being repetitive is a red flag. Distinguish between repetition due to bad hearing vs repetition due to memory loss 
* As long as you’re not comfortable, don’t take on the client. Ask them to get the paperwork first.
o Have knowledge and approval of contents of will 
- There’s another point here that I didn’t get – check slides if avail 
- Taking instructions 
o From testator/beneficiary? 
* Have to look out for undue influence 
o Certification of mental capacity 
o Thorough discussion with testator 
* We aren’t mere will-writers. Cannot just translate testator’s instructions to a written will. Have to look out for provisions that are unclear or can cause disputes. 
* E.g. if fella wants to give 10 houses to 4 children – which house goes to which child? 
* Check whether the beneficiary is legally able to own the house at all. 
* Check whether the testator really intends what he says to you. E.g. if testator wants to give entire estate to charity, ask why. Then advise them to state the reason clearly in the will 
o Presence of other persons 
* For situations where testator doesn’t speak English or feels more comfortable with their child around etc. 
* Look out for undue influence 
* Ask testator whether they have had other wills – if so, why are they changing their will? 
- Drafting a will 
o Understanding instructions 
o Revocation 
* Always make sure there’s a revocation clause, and make sure you revoke the correct things 
* It’s possible for people to have multiple wills, so be sure that the client is revoking the correct things. Not necessary that client intends to revoke the entirety of the old will. 
* Whether a will is revoked is a question of construction. Depends on drafting of revocation clause. 
o Use of precedents 
* A will is a very technical document, so you can’t draft by freehand. 
- Dispositions 
o Specific gifts (ademption / abatement) 
o General gift 
o Class gift 
* A gift to “my children”, vs “my children A, B and C”. If you pop out another child, then it makes a difference. 
* S 26 – if there is a residue of estate or if a person dies intestate (estate not determinable at time of death), and if Beneficiary A dies in the lifetime of the testator leaving issue (meaning they have a child), then the will takes effect as if that person had died immediately after the testator. Meaning that assets that would have gone to A would go to A’s beneficiaries under A’s will or intestate succession. 
* E.g. grampa leaves residue to father. Father has will for his portion of the residue to go to the kid. Father dies first, then grampa dies. In this situation, residue goes to the father’s estate and immediately on to the kid. But if the property is determinable in the grampa’s will, then this section doesn’t apply 
o Testamentary trust 
- Execution of the will 
o Formalities
o Execution
o Witness
* Age requirements
* Can the executor be a witness? Yes, as long as they’re not a beneficiary. 
* Can the executor be a beneficiary? Yes, but they can’t also be the witness. 
o Explanation of will – Muriel Chee
* Translation
* Explanation line by line 
* Ask appropriate questions to test mental capacity 
* Give or ask summary from testator 
- Post execution of the will – what next? 
o Wills Registry 
* Does not keep the wills themselves, but keeps a record that a will exists and where it’s kept 
o Safekeeping 
* Lawyers can keep the original of the will. But there is a responsibility and liability on the part of the lawyer. If anything happens to the testator, you have to approach the family and tell them you have the original will. 
* Do you keep it in the bank’s safe deposit box? Generally no because there
* Advice to client – keep it with your other important documents, but make sure someone knows where it is. And keep a copy in your office or something 
o Advice as to event of death 
o Revocation of wills (Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Wills Act)
* Section 13: will to be revoked by marriage unless expressed to be made in contemplation of a marriage
* Section 14: will not to be revoked by presumption from alteration in circumstances
* Section 15: no will to be revoked otherwise than in -
* Section 13;
* By another will or codicil executed in the manner by this Act required;
* By some writing declaring an intention to revoke it, and executed in the manner in which a will is by this Act required to be executed; or
* By the burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the will by the testator, or by some person in his presence and by his direction, with the intention of revoking it.
o Alterations to wills (Section 16 of the Wills Act)
* No obliteration, interlineation or other alteration made in any will after the execution thereof shall be valid except so far as the words or effect of the will before such alteration shall not be apparent, unless the alteration shall be executed in the like manner as by this Act is required for the execution of the will.
* A will referred to in subsection (1), with such alteration as part thereof, shall be deemed to be duly executed if the signature of the testator and the subscription of the witnesses be made in the margin or on some other part of the will opposite or near to the alteration or at the foot or end of or opposite to a memorandum referring to the alteration and written at the end or some other part of the will.
o Relevant provisions in the Civil Law Act pertaining to wills (Sections 23 to 27)
* Appointments to be valid notwithstanding one or more objects excluded, or only take an unsubstantial share
* Not to affect any deed which declares the amount of the share
* Not to give any other force to any appointment than the same would have had
* Executor deemed to be trustee for person entitled to residue on intestacy
* Executor of executor represents original testator

o (b)	the failure of a testator to appoint an executor; or
o (c)	the failure to obtain a probate of a will,
but is not broken by a temporary grant of administration if probate is subsequently granted.
