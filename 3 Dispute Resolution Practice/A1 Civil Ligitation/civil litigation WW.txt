*5 Ideals of the Rules of Court 2021
O 3 r 1 ROC 2021 – rules are to be given a purposive interpretation
- The Rules of Court 2021 seek to achieve the following Ideals in civil procedure:
a. Fair access to justice,
b. Expeditious proceedings,
c. Cost-effective work proportionate to:
(i) Nature and importance of action
(ii) Complexity of claim and difficulty or novelty of issues and questions it raises
(iii) Amount or value of claim 
d. Efficient use of court resources,
e. Fair and practical results suited to the needs of the parties.

Prof: not able to achieve all these ideals all of the time especially as they can conflict. Court will weigh up the diff ideals on a case-by-case basis and decide where to strike the balance.
- E.g. Df asks for more time to prepare defense as they are a layperson, need to find a lawyer, need to find documents [Ideals (1) vs (2); Court may thus choose to give some extra time but maybe not the full period that Df is asking for]

4. Which Court do you sue in? (jurisdictional limitations) 
5. Are there any dispute resolution clauses (e.g. exclusive/non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, arbitration clauses) that are applicable?
6. Are there any pre-action protocols? (medical negligence claims) [NB: BACKGROUND INFO ONLY]

Overriding time limit for all actions – 15 years from “starting date”
S24B(1) of Limitation Act 
- Any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty to which s24A applies shall not be brought after the expiration of 15 years from the starting date 

Definition of “starting date”: Date on which act or omission constituting negligence/nuisance/breach of duty occurred 
S24B(2) of Limitation Act

Claim by way of set-off or counterclaim are separate actions commencing on same date as the main action is pleaded
S31 of Limitation Act 
- Any claim by way of set-off or counterclaim shall be deemed to be a separate action and to have been commenced on the same date as the action in which the set-off or counterclaim is pleaded

Step 3: Can there be an amicable resolution?
Option 1: Parties have a positive duty to consider amicable resolution before and during action  
O 5 r 1(1) of ROC 2021
- Parties have a duty to consider amicable resolution before commencement and during the course of any action 

Claimant must make offer of amicable resolution before commencing action => Unless reasonable grounds not to
O 5 r 1(2)
- A party has to make an offer of amicable resolution before commencing action unless the party has reasonable grounds not to do so 

Contents of offer of amicable resolution 
O 5 r 1(3)
- Offer of amicable resolution in Order 5 means: 
* Making an offer to settle the action or appeal; OR 
* Making an offer to resolve the dispute other than by litigation, whether in whole or in part 

Defendant must not reject an offer of amicable resolution => Unless reasonable grounds to do so 
O 5 r 1(4) 
- A party to any proceedings must not reject an offer of amicable resolution unless the party has reasonable grounds to do so

What are reasonable grounds? 
- E.g. there is an urgent time bar issue – if you make offer of amicable resolution then you’ll be time-barred 
- E.g. claiming for fraud – doesn’t make sense to offer to amicably resolve with someone who is defrauding you 
- E.g. real risk of Df dissipating his assets – if an offer is made the Df might be alerted

Terms of amicable resolution 
Offer and rejection must be in writing 
O 5 r 2(1) 
- An offer of amicable resolution and any rejection must be in writing

Offer must be open for acceptance for at least 14 days unless parties agree otherwise 
O 5 r 2(2) 
- An offer of amicable resolution must be open for acceptance within a reasonable period of time and in any case, for at least 14 days, unless the parties otherwise agree

Offer without expiry date will expire once Court determines merits of action => Unless stated otherwise 
O 5 r 2(4) 
- Any offer of amicable resolution which does not state an expiry date expires once the Court has determined the merits of the action or appeal to which it relates unless the offeror has stated otherwise.

Court must not rely on rejected offers until Court has determined action and is dealing with issue of costs 
O 5 r 2(3)
- The terms of an offer that has been made and not accepted must not be relied upon or made known to the Court until after the Court has determined the merits of the action or appeal and is dealing with the issue of costs

Cost consequences for failure to consider amicable resolution 
O 21 r 4(c)
- If a party has not discharged its duty to consider amicable resolution of the dispute => Court may:
* Disallow or reduce a successful party’s costs; or 
* Order the successful party to pay costs 

No other consequences – proceedings can’t be struck out or anything. Only costs can be ordered. 
- The fact that the other party breached this duty is something that the party seeking costs can raise, in order to argue why costs should be awarded against the breaching party. Just something that goes towards the reasonableness of the party’s conduct. 

Option 2: Court can order parties to attempt an amicable resolution  
Court has power to order parties to attempt to resolve dispute by amicable resolution 
O 5 r 3(1) 
- The Court may order the parties to attempt to resolve the dispute by amicable resolution.
=> In exercising power, Court will have regard to ideals and other relevant circumstances including whether any of the parties have refused to attempt to resolve dispute by amicable resolution (O 5 r 3(2) ROC)

If party informs Court that he does not wish to attempt to resolve dispute by amicable resolution => Court may order party to submit sealed document setting out reasons for refusal => Sealed document will only be opened by Court after determination of action and dealing with issue of costs 
O 5 r 3(3)
- Without affecting the Court’s power under paragraph (1), if a party informs the Court that the party does not wish to attempt to resolve the dispute by amicable resolution, the Court may order the party to submit a sealed document setting out the party’s reasons for such refusal.

O 5 r 3(4) 
- The sealed document will only be opened by the Court after the determination of the merits of the action or appeal and its contents may be referred to on any issue of costs.


Step 4: Which Court do you sue in? 
Consider dispute resolution clauses 
- For contracting parties – Consider dispute resolution clauses like arbitration clauses, exclusive jurisdiction clauses and non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses 

Consider jurisdictional limitations of Courts 
- Summary of jurisdictional limitations: 
a. Small Claims Tribunal: <$20k, but <$30k with agreement from opposing party
b. Magistrate’s Court: <$60k (i.e. between $20 or 30-60K)
c. District Court: <$250k (i.e. between $60-250K)
d. High Court: >$250k 



Step 5: Are there any pre-action protocols which must be carried out? [NB: BACKGROUND INFO ONLY]
For Medical Negligence Claims – Must fill up Form 1 in Appendix H  
Paragraph 163 read with Appendix H of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Basically must fill up some Form 1 in Appendix H of the Practice Directions
- Purpose of protocol: Streamline the production of documents before action begins and to facilitate the exchange of information prior to filing of an OC with a view to resolving medical negligence disputes without protracted litigation

Para 163(2) of Supreme Court PD 2021
- If non-compliance with protocol has led to unnecessary costs, Court can make the following orders: 
a. An order disallowing a defaulting party his costs, or some part of his costs, even if he succeeds

Para 163(3) of Supreme Court PD 2021
- Court will consider non-compliance with protocol in exercising discretion when deciding amount of interest payable and may make the following orders:
a. An order awarding successful party who has complied with protocol interest from a date earlier than the date from which he would otherwise have been entitled to obtain interest 
b. An order depriving a successful party who has not complied with the protocol of interest in respect of such period as may be specified

Step 6: Are there any special considerations due to status of your client or the opposing party?  [NB: BACKGROUND INFO ONLY]
a. Bankrupt 
b. Person below 21 
c. Person lacking capacity under MCA
d. Group of persons 
e. Dead person

Bankrupt cannot commence, continue or defend action without previous sanction of Official Assignee => Unless 2 exceptions 
S401(1) of IRDA

B. Exception 2: Matrimonial proceedings and appeals: A matrimonial proceeding; or 
(ii) An appeal arising from (A) or (B) 
b. The bankrupt must not leave, or remain or reside outside Singapore without the previous permission of the Official Assignee 

If Bankrupt does not seek Official Assignee sanction => Bankrupt will be deemed as lacking locus standi 
Aarthar Ah Kong v OUE 
- Bankrupt must seek Official Assignee’s sanction prior to commencing an action including filing of a notice of appeal 
- Effect of not doing so:
a. Bankrupt will be deemed as lacking locus standi to commence action 

Official Assignee cannot grant retrospective sanction of an action already commenced
Aarthar Ah Kong v OUE 
- Official Assignee cannot grant retrospective sanction i.e. sanction cannot be granted ipso facto 

Person below 21 must be represented by litigation representative => Unless person above 18 (and below 21) and s36 of CLA applies  
O 4 r 2(a) of ROC 2021
- The following persons must be represented by a litigation representative in proceedings: A person who is below 21 years of age and who does not come under O 4 r1(a)

Issue: What if your client does not have enough evidence to commence proceedings? 
- Pre-action production of documents (pre-action discovery) 
- Pre-action production of information (pre-action interrogatories)



*PRE-ACTION PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION – AGAINST 3RD PARTY, IF PLAINTIFF NOT IN POSITION TO SUE YET BECAUSE IT NEEDS MORE INFO
Applicant can apply to Court for an order for non-party (need not be the main Df) to produce documents and information  
O 11 r 11(1) of ROC
- Court may order production of documents and information before commencement of proceedings or against a non-party to identify possible parties to any proceedings, to enable a party to trace the party’s property or for any other lawful purpose, in the interest of justice 

Rationale – to ensure that you have enough information to sue a party, instead of randomly suing people just so that you get evidence of who has actually wronged you. 
- Because of this, the respondent to this application need not be the actual defendant in the potential suit. But they must have some kind of nexus to the action – must have facilitated the wrongdoing somehow 
- The facilitation of the wrongdoing doesn’t need to be intentional (can be negligent, etc.) 
- This cannot be a complete fishing expedition – there must be a prima facie case of wrongdoing 

Ching Mun Fong v Standard Chartered Bank 
- Purpose of pre-action discovery: 
a. Accommodate the situation where a potential plaintiff did not have sufficient facts to commence proceedings
b. It is NOT meant to obtain evidence to boost the plaintiff’s case as that is achieved through post-action discovery 
c. **Pre-action discovery is unnecessary where potential plaintiff is in a position to commence proceedings

Court must not order production of document if production cannot be compelled in law 
O 11 r 11(2) of ROC 
- The Court must not order a document to be produced if its production cannot be compelled in law
=> E.g. If document is protected by privilege 

Applicant will be liable for reasonable costs arising out of application 
O 11 r 11(3) of ROC
- Non-party is entitled to all reasonable costs arising out of such an application 
* Non-party is "any counterparty who you are ordering pre-action discovery against", doesn’t matter who you eventually sue => TLDR Applicant pays all costs

Procedure for Pre-action production of documents and information
Part 1A: Applicant must establish credible evidence of a Singapore nexus to the alleged 3rd party’s wrongdoing to obtain order of pre-action production of documents against alleged 3rd party 

Part 1B: Alternatively: Applicant can also establish a likely prospect of subsequent proceedings being commenced in Singapore 
ED&F Man Capital Markets Ltd v Straits (Singapore) Pte Ltd 
- Applicant for pre-action disclosure must establish credible evidence of a Singapore nexus to the alleged third-party wrongdoing to obtain an order for pre-action disclosure/must establish a likely prospect of subsequent proceedings being commenced in Singapore 
a. Reason: Pre-action disclosure is an intrusive and compulsive process and Court’s powers do not extend to pre-action disclosure in aid of foreign proceedings 
- However, there will inevitably be situations where post-disclosure might cause another forum to emerge as a more appropriate forum and in that case, applicant for pre-action disclosure is free to commence proceedings there but he would not be permitted to use the documents and information obtained in the course of the pre-action disclosure application 

Part 2: Applicant must satisfy 2 requirements for Court to order pre-action production of documents 
Ching Mun Fong v Standard Chartered Bank 
- Requirements for pre-action discovery:
1. Requirement of relevance: Documents under pre-action discovery must be relevant 
2. Requirement of necessity: Pre-action discovery must be necessary 
3. Reasonable prima facie case of wrongdoing by intended Df – purpose of pre-action production is not to strengthen your case, but to get information to make out your case

Requirement of relevance
Ching Mun Fong v Standard Chartered Bank 
- Pre-action production of documents to enable applicant to have sufficient facts to commence proceedings

Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd
- Test of relevance is a threshold test 

Requirement of necessity 
Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd 
- Respondent to the application must have facilitated the wrongdoing (but not necessarily culpable in any way). All he needs to have done is facilitated the wrongdoing which may be done innocently, e.g. bank transferring funds from Pf’s account to Df’s account – so the bank has the information and documents and facilitated the transfer of funds
- Test for necessity: Are the pre-action interrogatories applied for necessary to ascertain if his cause of action is viable?
a. Proportionality,
b. Availability of alternative avenues to obtain information 
c. How intrusive the interrogatories are especially where there are serious allegations of wrongdoing that attract public interest
d. Whether an applicant has a complete cause of action against an identified party, then pre-action disclosure is not necessary  

Ching Mun Fong v Standard Chartered Bank
- Pre-action production of documents is necessary if the documents, from their inception, are within the exclusive possession of the respondent
a. If potential plaintiff knew the contents of the documents, then pre-action discovery is unnecessary => Potential plaintiff would be entitled to discovery of the documents after commencing proceedings

Part 3: Court ought to question whether it is just for the Applicant to secure information sought even before commencement of proceedings 
Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd
- Final analysis: Court ought to question whether it is just for the applicant to secure the information sought even before commencement of proceedings
a. Applicant must show circumstances such that the case differs from the normal
b. Court must ensure that the application is not employed as an instrument to embarrass or oppress others

- Principles:
a. Court should only make an order if it has been provided with sufficient information to adequately address the necessity of the disclosure 
b. It is easier for Court to ascertain relevance if claimant is able to put a clear cause of action before the Court
c. If proceedings can be commenced against an already identifiable party, reasons ought to be given why it is neither convenient nor just for the information to be sought only after commencement of proceedings 



*MODES OF COMMENCING CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN THE GENERAL DIVISION OF THE HIGH COURT
What’s the difference between Originating Claim and Originating Application?
1. Originating Claim (formerly Writ of Summons): Generally used for cases where material facts are in dispute 
o Accompanied by statement of claim, OR
o With a general endorsement – special case where the limitation period for the cause of action will expire within 14 days after the OC is issued, then a concise description of the claim is sufficient (but a statement of claim will still need to be filed eventually)
o For claim for personal injury, need to include an annex with the medical report and statement of special damages to the OC

2. Originating Application (formerly Originating Summons): Generally used for cases where material facts are not in dispute and the primary issue is a question of construction of written law, instrument or document or a question of law
o With or without notice 
o Supporting affidavit 

There are some kinds of actions that may only be commenced by certain kind of application – specified in the rules for these specific situations 
- E.g. setting aside of arbitral award or winding up application – must be OA 

How do I know whether there are material facts in dispute? 
- No need to ask the other party 
- Use your own judgment as the client’s lawyer – when you send letter of demand, can assess the counterparty’s response to see whether there are material facts in dispute 
o If the counterparty responds to an OA with lots of factual disputes, there is a procedure to convert the OA to an OC. 


Issue: Advising client to commence civil proceedings: whether to commence civil proceedings by Originating Claim or Originating Application? 
Originating Claim: Where material facts are in dispute 
O 6 r 1(2)
- Claimant must commence proceedings by an OC where the material facts are in dispute

Originating Application: (1) Where ROC/Written law requires (2) Proceedings concern application to Court (3) Proceedings concern construction of written law, instrument, document + Material facts not in dispute
O 6 r 1(3)
- Claimant must commence proceedings by an OA where: 
a. ROC or any written law requires it; or 
b. Proceedings concern an application made to the Court under any written law; or 
c. Proceedings concern solely or primarily the construction of any written law, instrument, document or some question of law and the material facts are not in dispute 

Court can order for OA to be converted into OC if there are disputes of fact in OA supporting affidavit 
O 15 r 7(6)(c)
- Where Court is of the view that there are disputes of facts in the OA’s affidavit, Court may order the OA to be converted into an OC with the necessary directions 
*Originating Claim (there is always a counterparty)
Overview: 
1. Claimant prepares OC with correct form endorsement, annexure
2. Claimant gets the OC issued 
3. Claimant takes note of time period where OC is valid for service (maximum time for service) 
4. Either:
a. Claimant serves OC in Singapore on Df; or 
b. Claimant serves OC out of Singapore on Df 
5. Claimant serves Statement of Claim (SOC) on Df
6. Df serves Notice of Intention to Contest or Not Contest on Claimant
7. Either/or:
a. Df serves Defense on Claimant; and/or
b. Df files and serves counterclaim on Claimant
8. Claimant files and serves Defence to Counterclaim on Df 
9. Parties must not file and serve any Further Pleadings unless Court has granted approval 

Step 1: Claimant prepares OC with correct form endorsement, annexure 
Aka Form, Endorsements and Annexures 
Form
O 6 r 5(1)
- An OC must be in Form 8 (from Appendix A to the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021)

Endorsements
Option 1: OC endorsed with Statement of Claim in Form 9 
Option 2: If limitation period for cause of action will expire within 14 days after OC is issued => OC can be endorsed with concise description of the claim 
O 6 r 5(2)
- An OC may be endorsed generally with: 
a. A general endorsement with a concise description of the claim; or 
b. A statement of claim in Form 9 (from Appendix A to the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021)

Statement of claim – concise summary of material facts 
General endorsement – brief summary of the claim with just the cause of action 

O 6 r 5(4)
- Generally, OC must be accompanied with Statement of Claim 
- But if the limitation period for the cause of action will expire within 14 days after the OC is issued then OC can be endorsed generally with a concise description of the claim 
- Court can also allow general endorsement in special cases – this is a case-by-case basis 

Even in a generally endorsed OC, you eventually need to file a SOC. The issue here is just whether the SOC must be attached to the OC. 

Annexures 
For claims for personal injury – Annex medical report and statement of special damages to OC
O 6 r 5(2)
- For claims for personal injuries, claimant must annex a medical report and a statement of special damages claimed to the OC 

NB: for admiralty proceedings, different rules apply (Order 33 Rule 2 ROC 2021)
* An action in rem must be begun by originating claim; and the originating claim must be in Form 48.
* The originating claim by which an Admiralty action in personam is begun must be in Form 8 and the words “admiralty action in personam” must be inserted above the space for the number of the originating claim.

Step 2: Claimant gets the OC issued (same for OA)
OC is deemed issued when Registrar numbers, signs, seals and dates it 
O 6 r 2
- An OC or OA is deemed issued when the Registrar numbers, signs, seals and dates it

Step 3: Claimant takes note of time period where OC is valid for service (maximum time for service) (same for OA)
OC valid for service for 3 months beginning with date of issue
O 6 r 3(1)
- An OC or OA is valid for service for 3 months beginning with the date of its issue 

Procedure to extend validity of OC for service 
Applicant can make application to extend validity of OC for service
O 6 r 3(2)
- An application may be made to extend the validity of the OC or OA for service if it has not been served on all or any of the defendants before or after it expires 

Court may extend validity only twice and by not more than 3 months each time
O 6 r 3(4) 
- Except in a special case, Court may extend validity of OC or OA only twice and by not more than 3 months each time 

Extension period to start the following day after previous deadline 
O 6 r 3(3) 
- Court may order extension of the validity of the OC or OA for service by a period beginning with the day next following that on which the OC or OA would otherwise expire

Principles when Court deciding whether to grant extension 
Lim Hong Kan & Ors v Mohd Sanudin bin Ahmad 
- Court’s discretion to extend the validity of any writ should be exercised only for good reason: 
a. Balance of hardship between parties could be a relevant matter
b. Lower Court decisions on extension should not be interfered with by the appellate court except on special grounds

- Court allowed for extension in this case as:
a. The plaintiff was a menial laborer who had already been ordered to pay costs in a different suit and the plaintiff wanted to save legal costs 
b. The second action would be unnecessary if the plaintiff succeeds in his first appeal and the date of the first appeal is fixed outside of the validity period of the writ of the second action 

The Lircay 
- Good reasons to grant extension: 
a. Where there was an express or implied agreement between parties to defer service of writ 
b. Where delay concerning the application to extend the validity of the writ was induced or contributed by the defendant
c. Difficulty in effective service especially if defendant was evading service 

Step 4A: Claimant serves OC in Singapore on Defendant (within 14 days of OC being issued)

* Note: If service out of Singapore, then 28 days (O 6 r 5(7))

Special Scenario: If Claimant attends first case conference but has not served OC on Defendant
O 9 r 5 
- If claimant attends first case conference but has not served the claimant’s OC or OA on the defendant, the Court may:
a. Court may dismiss Claimant’s action if Claimant had not taken reasonable steps to effect service expeditiously; OR
b. Court may fix second case conference and order Claimant to:
(i) Serve the originating process within 14 days after date of first case conference; OR 
(ii) Apply for substituted service within that time

*NOTE: Pleadings – comprise: (1) SOC (by Pf), (2) Defence (by Df), (3) Counterclaim (by Df), (4) Defence to Counterclaim (by Pf). 
- This is important because the claim cannot exceed the bounds of these pleadings 


*Originating Application (simpler than originating claim, may not have a counterparty)
Step 1: Claimant prepares OA in prescribed form and supporting affidavit

a. In accordance with Rule 2; or 
b. May be sent by post or otherwise by Registrar to the Magistrate, Registrar or other appropriate officer of any court exercising civil jurisdiction in the area which the person to be served is said to be or to be carrying on business for service on the defendant => The OC is deemed to be duly served if it is returned with an endorsement of service and with an affidavit of such service

O 8 r 4
- If Originating Process is issued by State Courts to be served out of Singapore, it: 
a. Must be sent by Registrar of State Courts to the Registrar of the Supreme Court; and

Filing of Defendant’s Affidavit is not treated as submission to jurisdiction 
O 6 r 12(5)
- A Defendant’s affidavit filed under O 6 r 12(5) is not treated as a submission to jurisdiction (i.e. just because Df filled affidavit does not mean it is agreeing or submitting to the court’s jurisdiction)

*Step 6: Defendant files and serves Counterclaim on Claimant
Defendant must include Counterclaim in Defendant’s Affidavit (cf Defendant’s Defense and Counterclaim which are separate under an originating claim)
O 6 r 14
- If defendant intends to make a counterclaim in the OA against the claimant, defendant must include it in the defendant’s affidavit together with all the evidence that is necessary for the counterclaim

How does the claimant file a defense to the counterclaim? – apply to court under O 6 r 12(6) – court will likely order claimant to file an affidavit that is confined to defending the counterclaim

Step 7: Parties must not file and serve any Further Affidavits except in a special case  
Parties must not file any Further Affidavits except in a special case 
O 6 r 12(6)

- E.g. in conspiracy claim, Claimant may argue that he is unable to properly present his case before seeing the relevant documents in the hands of the conspirators 
If there are many factual contentions then AEICs are needed to clarify the key issues 
Edge cases 
Oral EIC / Dispensing with requirement of AEIC 
- If witness is uncooperative – can apply for the requirement of the AEIC of this witness to be dispensed with. Instead, can subpoena the witness to compel him to take the stand. 
o Ordinarily, the court will require that a list of questions be sent to the counterparty or even the witness himself, for fairness 

Illiterate witnesses 
- AEIC still required – O 15 r something 
- AEIC read out to witness in the presence of Commissioner for Oaths, then witness agrees and signs 

Document Production (in OC)
Directions for document production will be given by the court at case conference. 

Parties to exchange list and copies of: 
- Documents relied on 
- Known adverse documents 
o Documents that a party knows or ought to know exist, that are adverse to that party’s case 
- Any other documents agreed/ordered 

There is a continuing duty to produce both adverse documents and documents intended to be relied on.



*B. [IN OC] SINGLE APPLICATION PENDING TRIAL (SAPT)
This is an omnibus / umbrella application that is supposed to contain all interlocutory applications including security for costs, further and better particulars, amendment of pleadings, consolidation, judgement on admissions, preliminary questions, etc. 
- With some exceptions, you will need permission to file other applications outside of SAPT 
- Cannot take out any interlocutory application within 14 days of trial unless there is a special case and with the trial judge’s permission 
o No cases explaining what special cases might be, but probably must explain why the application is brought so late and why it is necessary 
- Procedure – 
o Court will instruct parties to take directions for SAPT at the next case conference 
o When directions are given to prepare for SAPT, parties are to prepare the SAPT checklist – para 56 of PD 
* E.g. if a party wishes to file a few applications, the party must look for these applications in the SAPT checklist, and propose a sequence for these applications to be heard. 
* The other party will then insert their comments on the sequence, on the same checklist, in a different color. 
* This is then filed in court and the court will consider the parties’ positions and decide on a hearing order in the RCC on SAPT 
* Where both parties make SAPT, court will decide on both. 

Purpose of SAPT
O 9 r 9(1)
- To allow the Court to consider all matters necessary to bring the proceedings to conclusion in accordance with the Ideals
Timing – when will the court give directions for the filing of a SAPT?
Happens after AEICs or after exchange of documents 
- Depending on whether exchange of documents or AEIC goes first 
- Either: 
(a) after AEICs but before documents are exchanged, if the court orders AEICs before documents (so AEIC-SAPT-docs); or 
(b) after exchange of documents, if the court decides not to order AEICs before documents (so docs-SAPT-AEIC).

What goes into the SAPT?

SAPT Checklist
- It is not contemplated that every single component of the single application will be heard inside a single hearing. The court will decide the sequence in which the individual component applications are to be heard and decided

- For the court to decide the order, parties are required to file a SAPT checklist for parties to indicate their preferred sequence of the matters in the SAPT, in accordance with Paragraph 56(12) to 56(16) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 read with Form B8 of Appendix B of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021

- Directions to complete the SAPT checklist will come at least 2 weeks before the date of the Registrar’s Case Conference (RCC) where the issue of the filing of the SAPT will be discussed (“Relevant RCC”), or within such other period as the court may direct

- After completing columns A, B and C, the applicant serves the SAPT checklist on the respondent, for them to confirm the applicant’s preferred sequence (either agree or do not agree). If respondent does not agree, it must fill its preferred sequence. Both parties must then provide brief reasons on their positions.

- Once SAPT checklist is fully completed, the respondent party must file it at least 1 week before the Relevant RCC. At the relevant RCC, the court will issue directions for the filing of the SAPT and on the sequence of matters to be heard for the SAPT, having regard to what parties have indicated.

AFTER THE SEQUENCE OF MATTERS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED (SAPT checklist is before and separate from the applications within the SAPT)
- Applying party then has to file its SAPT (supported by affidavit) within 21 days after the Relevant RCC. The opposing party then has 21 days to file and serve an affidavit in reply (O 9 r 9(5) ROC 2021).

 


*Applications that can be made outside SAPT platform, without court’s prior permission – O 9 r 9(7) 
No application may be taken out by any party at any time other than as directed at the case conference or with the Court’s approval, except an application for —
a) an injunction or a search order which may include an application for any other matter if it is incidental to the injunction or search order;
b) substituted service;
c) service out of Singapore;
d) setting aside service of an originating process;
e) judgment in default of a notice of intention to contest or not contest an originating claim;
f) judgment in default of defence;
g) summary judgment;
h) striking out of the whole of an action or defence;
i) stay of the whole action;
j) stay of enforcement of a judgment or order;
k) an enforcement order;
l) permission to appeal;
m) transfer of proceedings under the State Courts Act;
n) setting aside third party proceedings; or
o) permission to make an application for a committal order.

This carve-out list is EXHAUSTIVE – so anything else outside this must be brought in a SAPT

--> for these applications, no need to wait for the SAPT process. It can be filed without obtaining prior approval of the court.


**Seeking approval to file applications outside the SAPT that are NOT in the “carve out” list – O 9 r 9(8) and O 9 r 9(9)
- Parties can seek to bring an application that is NOT within the “carve out” list (SINCE THINGS IN THE CARVE OUT LIST CAN JUST BE BROUGHT WITHOUT COURT PERMISSION):
(a) prematurely (before the SAPT process) or 
(b) late (after the SAPT process), 
by a way of a letter to the court using Form B9 (paragraph 66(6) of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021)

- The Court may deal with the request summarily or it may fix a Case Conference to deal with the request.

- However, there is a prohibition on filing such applications LATE, within 14 days before commencement of the trial (and for the duration of the trial ending with the court’s decision on the merits), unless (O 9 r 9(10) ROC):
(a) It is a special case, and
(b) It is with the trial judge’s approval (such approval CANNOT be granted by the registrar, it must be from the trial judge) --> such approval must be obtained by letter via Form B9 setting out the essence of the intended application and reasons why there is a special case (O 9 r 9(11) ROC)

Exceptional circumstances where applications may be made outside of SAPT – 
- If there is a sudden change of facts that will affect the content of the pleadings, then it would save time and costs to amend the pleadings first instead of finishing the document exchange and then applying to amend pleadings under SAPT. Because documents depend on the content of the pleadings. 
- Alternatively where certain documents were only disclosed during SAPT – then need to amend pleadings, but this can only be done outside the SAPT process which is already filed – so can apply to court for permission to amend pleadings outside SAPT
- Upon application for production of specific documents in the SAPT and the production of such documents, you discover that there are other documents referred to. Then can file the application for further discovery after the SAPT. 


Addition and removal of parties 
SAPT matter: Addition and removal of parties
O 9 r 9(4)(a) 
- Application for addition and removal of parties is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT

Court power to add or remove parties 
O 9 r 10(1)
- Court may
* Add or remove claimants or defendants 
* Give permission for defendant to issue a 3rd party notice in accordance with O 10 
* Give directions for originating process to be served on any person who may have an interest in the action 

Person seeking to be added can seek a case conference 
Person seeking to be added can serve letter to Court and all parties to seek a case conference
O 9 r 10(2)
- Any person seeking to be added as a party may attend a case conference if the person is aware of it and may seek a case conference by letter addressed to the Court and copied to all the parties 

Effective date of commencement 
Person added as Defendant => Action will be deemed to commence against that person
O 9 r 10(3)
- Where a person is added as a defendant, action will be deemed to be commenced against that person on the date on which the amendment to the action is made 

Consolidation, joint trials, consecutive trials or stays 
- Consolidation: Combine separate individual actions into one and get a single judgement 
- Joint trials: Hear individual actions in one trial  
- Stays: Staying other trials until current trial has finished

SAPT matter: Consolidation, joint trials, consecutive trials or stays
O 9 r 9(4)(b)
- Application for consolidation, joint trials, consecutive trials or stays is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT
Usually a matter for OC, but sometimes OAs will be consolidated too 

Applicant need satisfy any ground for Court to order consolidation, joint trials, consecutive trials or stays 
O 9 r 11
- Court may order 2 or more actions to be consolidated, order them to be tried together, or to be tried consecutively or for any of them to be stayed pending the determination of another if the Court is of the opinion that: 
a. Ground 1: There is some common question of law in the action; OR  
b. Ground 2: Reliefs claimed in the actions concern or arise out of the same factual situation; OR 
c. Ground 3: It is appropriate to do so 
- Factors that the court considers – whether there are time/cost savings, whether parties would be prejudiced etc. 

Different kinds of consolidation under O 9 r 11
- Formal consolidation 
o Where 2 OCs are filed, there will initially be 2 sets of proceedings 
o After consolidation, there will only be a single set of proceedings. One case file, one case number 
- Informal consolidation – Tried together / one after another 
o Usually when there are similarities, e.g. overlaps in evidence or issues. 
o Same case conference, same trial judge
o Same judge will preside over both cases, which may be heard at the same time or sequentially 
o Rationale – to prevent duplication of work (calling witnesses etc.) and discrepancy between findings 
- Stay pending determination of another action 
o Usually in the case where the first case (which is stayed) is dependent on the outcome or findings that must be made in the second case (determinative proceedings)




*C. SECURITY FOR COSTS 
- Give defendant some assurance that his legal fees will be paid for when he is being asked to fight the trial and he wins (i.e. if the claimant loses)
(if part of OC) SAPT matter: Asking Claimant to put up security for Defendant’s costs 
O 9 r 9(4)(d)
- Application by defendant for claimant to put up security for defendant’s cost of action is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT (if OC)
Type of security ordered 
- Usually – payment into court 
- Bank guarantee on terms that are satisfactory to the other party 
- Solicitors’ undertaking – NOTE – as a solicitor, you should NOT give this undertaking unless and until you have received this amount from the client, otherwise you’re personally liable 

References to “claimant” and “defendant” are to be construed as references to persons in these positions (O 9 r 12(6) ROC)
- i.e. in a counterclaim, a defendant who is pursuing the counterclaim stands in the position of the claimant for the purposes of security of costs, and the claimant stands in the position of the defendant. So the claimant (as the “defendant” now) can apply for security of costs, in relation to the counterclaim, from the defendant (the “claimant” now)

Defendant needs to satisfy *2-stage Test for Court to order Claimant to put up security for Defendant’s legal costs 
1. Defendant needs to satisfy one of the 3 grounds (for jurisdiction)
2. Court must exercise discretion to make the order for security 

Stage 1: Defendant needs to satisfy one of the grounds when applying to Court for Claimant to put up security for Defendant’s legal costs 
O 9 r 12(1)
- Defendant may apply for security for the defendant’s costs of the action if:  
a. Ground 1: Claimant is not ordinarily resident in Singapore (so out of jurisdiction); OR  
o Definition of ordinarily resident: Claimant is ordinarily resident in a place or country if he adopts the place voluntarily AND has settled purpose and regular life in the place, whether of short or of long duration (Tjong Very Sumito v Chan Sing En)
o Person may be ordinarily resident in more than one country if that person had voluntarily adopted more than one place as their residence with settled purpose. 
o If person is ordinarily resident in both Singapore and a foreign country => It would be a strong factor under the second-stage against ordering security for costs
o Person may not be ordinarily resident in any country

b. Ground 2: Claimant is a nominal claimant suing for another’s benefit or is being funded by non-party + Reason to believe Claimant will be unable to pay Defendant’s legal costs; OR 
E.g. company in liquidation (company has not assets) and liquidator is in charge, creditor may find that it is in their interest for the liquidator to commence proceedings against a company debtor – so creditor may fund the litigation (so the company in liquidation will be the claimant, but party who will benefit from outcome of proceedings is the creditor)
E.g. insured person claiming under insurance policy, but insured person already assigned proceeds to someone else. Insured is still the contractual party - but benefits is the assignee

c. Ground 3: Claimant not stated or incorrectly stated address in the OC/OA, or changed address during course of proceedings to evade consequences of litigation. --> must be for purpose of evading, merely changing address is insufficient

O 9 r 12(2)
- Ground 4: If Claimant is a corporation – There is credible testimony and reason to believe that Claimant will be unable to pay Defendant’s legal costs:  S388 of Companies Act applies if claimant is a company – There is credible testimony and reason to believe that the claimant-company will be unable to pay the defendant’s legal costs if defendant is successful 

S388 of Companies Act (ordering a security for costs against a company)
- Where the claimant is a corporation, the Court may require the claimant to give sufficient security for the defendants costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given if: 
* It appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in the defendant’s defense

Stage 2: Court will consider all the circumstances and decide whether it is just to order the Claimant to provide security for the Defendant’s costs, and if so, the extent of security  
Even if the threshold requirements are met in stage 1 above, the court still has discretion to order SFC or not in stage 2

Tjong Very Sumito v Chan Sing En 
- If Claimant is ordinarily resident in Singapore => Less likely to grant order for security 
- If Claimants do not have fixed assets in Singapore which can satisfy a possible order of costs against claimant => More likely to grant order for security
- Where a plaintiff is ordinarily resident in the jurisdiction, this is a strong factor in favour of the court refusing to exercise its discretion to order security for costs. It is in opposition to the usual rule that other matters being equal, security is normally ordered against plaintiffs resident outside of jurisdiction.

Creative Elegance (M) Sdn Bhd v Puay Kim Seng [1999] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [13]–[25]
- Factors leaning against ordering Claimant to put up security for Defendant’s costs: 
a. If claimant has a bona fide claim with a reasonable prospect of success => Less likely to grant order for security 
b. If order for security will stifle the claimant’s case given its prevailing economic condition => Less likely to grant order for security 
c. If easy to enforce payment of defendant’s costs => Less likely to grant order for security 
Other factors – 
- whether the claimant has a propensity to avoid paying costs in the past
- The strength of the case – though the courts won’t delve into the merits of the case at an interlocutory level, if the claimant’s case appears very weak the court may exercise its discretion to order SFC 

* Once the condition under the respective provision is satisfied, the court’s discretion is invoked, and in exercise of that discretion the court decides whether or not to order security for costs against the plaintiff.
* The court considers all the circumstances and decide whether it is just to order the plaintiff to provide security for costs and the extent of such security.
* Factors:
o Whether Pf has a bona fide, genuine claim and a reasonable prospect of success;
o Whether application for security being used oppressively to try and stifle a genuine claim; 
o Whether Pf’s lack of means was brought by any conduct by the Df; an
o Ease of enforcement of the judgment. 



SAPT matter: Asking non-party to put up security for Defendant’s costs 
O 9 r 9(4)(d)
- Application by defendant for non-party to put up security for defendant’s cost of action is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT

Defendant need satisfy one of the grounds for Court to order non-party to put up security for Defendant’s legal costs 
O 9 r 12(3)
- Defendant may apply for security for the defendant’s costs of the action to be provided by a non-party, if:
a. Ground 1: Non-party has assigned right in action to the Claimant in return for share of money recovered in the action: That non-party has assigned his right in action to the claimant in return for a share of any money or property which the claimant may recover in the action; OR 
b. Ground 2: Non-party has contributed to Claimant’s legal costs in return for share of money recovered in the action: That non-party has contributed or agreed to contribute to the claimant’s costs in return for a share of any money or property which the claimant may recover in the action; OR 
c. Ground 3: Non-party has contributed to Claimant’s legal costs and actively instigated Claimant to maintain action: That non-party has contributed or agreed to contribute to the claimant’s costs and actively instigates or encourages the claimant to maintain the claimant’s actions 

Procedure to apply to Court for non-party to put up security for cost 
Defendant must apply by summons and personally serve on non-party and every party to the proceedings 
O 9 r 12(4)
An application for an order under O 9 r 12(3) must be made by summons => Summons must be personally served on the non-party and ordinarily served on every party to the proceedings 




*D. [IN OC] FURTHER AND BETTER PARTICULARS (FBP)
- Application which can be filed to get further particulars about allegations made in the pleadings (i.e. statement of claim, defense, reply, etc.)
- Only applicable to OCs because it relates to pleadings, which OAs don’t have. 
Preliminary: Request for further and better particulars must be first sent by way of letter and an informal inquiry must be made first => If not Court may make costs orders against applicant 

SAPT matter: Asking opposing party to furnish further and better particulars 
O 9 r 9(4)(e)
- Application for further and better particulars is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT

3 Requirement for Court to order any party to furnish FBP of any matter
Requirement 1: The FBP sought are necessary on the facts of the case 
O 9 r 13
- Court may order a party to serve on any other party particulars of any matter stated in the first-mentioned party’s pleading if the Court is of the opinion that the particulars are necessary on the facts of the case 
- This is for the opposing party to know the case it has to meet 

Requirement 2: The FBP sought relates to material facts and not evidence 
Element Six Technologies Ltd v IIA Technologies Pte Ltd
- Pleadings only need to contain material facts (must be pleaded, if not present then can be struck out) and not evidence => Hence, FBP cannot be used to ask for more evidence
- If a claim doesn’t set out all the material facts, the omission is grounds for striking out 
Differentiating between material facts and evidence
- Material facts: Facts that are necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action so that the opposing party is given fair notice of the case to be met and may direct his evidence to address the case 
- Evidence: Supporting facts or subordinate facts that are the means of proving the material facts 
- Example – False representation in a tenancy agreement – that URA allows F&B business on the premises 
o Material fact that must be pleaded – the fact that there was a representation from A to B that the premises were usable for F&B 
* If you don’t plead this element that there was a representation, the claim is liable to be struck out 
o Particulars of this representation – if you simply assert that there was a representation, the defendant doesn’t know the case he has to meet. The claimant must furnish more particulars, about the date of the representation, whether it was made verbally or in writing --> THESE SHOULD STILL BE PLEADED SO D KNOWS WHAT C IS REFERRING TO
o What is evidence in this case? 
* A copy of the email, a statement of witnesses who will vouch for the fact stated 

Distinction between FBPs and specific discovery
- FBP relates to facts 
- Discovery relates to evidence – e.g. documents that you believe are in possession of the other party 

Requirement 3: FBP should NOT be granted if applicant already knows what the alleged cause of actions and remedies are sought by the opposing party
Sharikat Logistics Pte Ltd v Ong Boon Chuan
- Order for FBP should NOT be granted for the defendant if it already knows what the alleged cause of action and remedies sought by the claimant 
- Reason: Pleadings only need to state material facts and need not contain all the evidence, order for FBP should only be used for particularizing material facts and should not be used to request for evidence 

Procedure for request for further and better particulars 
If more than 5 categories or sub-categories of requests are sought => Parties must complete summary table (Form B10 of Appendix B to Supreme Court PD 2021)
Para 68 of Supreme Court PD 2021
- Where more than 5 categories of further and better particulars are sought, parties must complete the Summary Table instead of filing written submissions 





*E. [IN OC] AMENDMENT OF PLEADINGS 
- Correct errors, add more points, remove points in the pleadings (e.g. statement of claim, reply)
- For use in OC only, part of SAPT 
SAPT matter: Amendment of pleadings  
O 9 r 9(4)(f)
- Application to amend pleadings is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT
**The threshold for amendment of pleadings is usually not very high (especially if amendments are made at early stage and can be compensated by costs), except in 2 situations:
1. Amendments made after expiry of statutory limitation period (O 9 r 14 ROC, see below)
2. Amendments made less than 14 days before trial – no amendments allowed except in special case (O 9 r 14(3) ROC) --> this is a very high threshold

Preliminary Issues
General prohibition against amendment of pleadings 14 days before commencement of trial => Unless special case 
O 9 r 14(3) 
- Court must not allow any pleading to be amended less than 14 days before the commencement of the trial except in a special case 
Court may consider events occurring AFTER the OC is filed 
O 9 r 14(2) 
- In a special case, the Court may consider events that occurred after the originating claim is filed to be pleaded even though they do not relate back to the date of the filing of the originating claim
o No authorities at the moment on what makes a “special case” but will need very good reasons
*Inferences may be drawn if material facts in the pleadings are amended 
O 9 r 14(6)
- If material facts in the pleadings are amended, the Court may draw the appropriate inferences 
- E.g. material facts are important in pleadings and should be verified – if you amend later, it calls into question the certification of truth given previously. So inferences may be made regarding credibility of the party amending

Method 1 of amending: with written agreement between the parties, without prior court permission
2 requirements for amendment of pleadings without Court approval 
O 9 r 14(5)
- Any pleadings can be amended without court approval if: 
* Requirement 1: It is amended by written agreement between parties; AND 
* Requirement 2: It is amended more than 14 days before commencement of trial 
If any of these requirements are not met (no written agreement or if it is less than 14 days before commencement of trial), must seek court permission (i.e. method 2).

Method 2 of amending: with court’s permission
O 9 r 14(1)-(3)
- Court may allow parties to amend pleadings, but a “special case” needs to be shown
- The court has the power to allow amendment to pleadings at any stage, including cases on appeal
Court’s considerations giving approval to any party to amend pleadings
Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd 
1. *Whether amendment sought would allow the real issues in proceedings to be determined, thereby ensuring the ends of substantive justice are met --> MAIN THRESHOLD FOR COURT ALLOWING AMENDMENT OF PLEADING
2. Whether amendment would cause injustice or injury to the opposing party which could not be compensated by an order for costs or otherwise => If so, disallow amendment 
3. Whether procedural fairness to the opposing party is maintained 
a. Delay alone would not prevent amendments but may increase prejudice to opposing party 

*Amendment of pleadings after expiry of statutory limitation period 
Part 1: Court must determine whether the amendment would prejudice the opposing party’s limitation defense 
Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3322 v Mer Vue Developments Pte Ltd 
- Court must consider: Whether the amendment effectively allows the claimant to prosecute a claim which would otherwise have been time-barred if it were brought under a new writ 
--> i.e. even though statutory limitation period has expired, if amendment to pleadings do not prejudice whether the opponent can rely on a time bar as a defence (e.g. clerical errors), then court will just consider if it was just to amend pleadings

--> but if amendment to pleadings prejudices the opponent’s ability to rely on the time bar, then need to look at the specific circumstances under O 9 r 14(4)

Part 2A: If it is determined that the amendment would not prejudice the other party’s limitation defense, then the Court would then consider whether it would be just to allow applicant to amend the pleadings under O 9 r 14(1) (Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3322 v Mer Vue Developments Pte Ltd )
1. If it is determined that amendment would prejudice the other party’s limitation defense then Court will consider whether it can allow amendment under O 9 r 14(4) (previously O 20 r 5(2) – 5(5))
- Example: Cause of action is to be distinguished from a relief claimed (Multistar v Geocon Piling) => If a new relief is sought to be introduced, it would never prejudice opposing party’s limitation defense => Go under O 9 r 14(1) 
- Although Mer Vue was decided under the old RoC 2014, it is likely to continue to apply as authority under RoC 2021.

Part 2: If it is determined that the amendment would prejudice the other party’s limitation defense, then the Court can only allow the amendment of pleadings in any of the 3 situations listed in O 9 r 14(4) 
O 9 r 14(4)
- Where the relevant limitation period has expired, the Court may allow amendment in the following circumstances: 
a. Situation 1: Amendment to correct party’s name – If it was a genuine mistake and not misleading as to the identity of the party in question: even if its alleged effect will be to substitute a new party
b. Situation 2: Amendment to alter capacity in which party sues – If party might have sued in that capacity at the time OC was issued or the counterclaim was made
c. Situation 3: Amendment to add or substitute new cause of action – If new cause of action arises out of substantially the same facts as existing cause of action for which relief has already been claimed in the same action


*F. STRIKING OUT (OC / OA)
- Application to strike out claimant’s pleadings (by defendant) and defendant’s pleadings (by claimant)
- If defendant can strike out all of claimant’s pleadings then can also ask for case to be dismissed 
- If claimant can strike out all of defendant’s pleadings then can also ask for judgement to be entered
- If want to strike out part of pleadings => SAPT matter
- If want strike out entire pleadings => Non-SAPT matter (part of “carve out” list) --> so no need court permission
- Can strike out OA as if pleading (based on the 3 grounds below) – not SAPT as it is not applicable for OA 
- Can also apply to strike out affidavits (certain parts or entire affidavit)

SAPT matter – Application to strike out part of action/defense
O 9 r 9(4)(h)
- Application to strike out part of action/defense is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT

Non-SAPT matter – Application to strike out entire action/defense 
O 9 r 9(7)(h)
- Application to strike out entire action/defense is not a matter to be dealt with under SAPT => Implication: Do not need Court’s approval if application is filed outside SAPT 

Applicant must satisfy one of the 3 grounds for striking out part of/whole action/defense 
O 9 r 16(1) 
- Court may order any or part of any pleading to be struck out or amended on the ground that:
a. Ground 1: Pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action or defense; OR  
b. Ground 2: Pleading is an abuse of process of the Court; OR 
c. Ground 3: It is in the interests of justice to do so 
and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgement to be entered accordingly 

General principles for all Grounds --> GROUNDS FOR STRIKING OUT IS A HIGH THRESHOLD
Principle 1: Power to strike out should only be invoked in plain and obvious cases (Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin)

Principle 2: Where application to strike out involves lengthy arguments => No striking out unless Court has doubts as to soundness of pleading and Court is satisfied that striking out reduces burden of preparing for trial (Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin)
- Where application to strike out involves lengthy arguments, the Court should decline to strike out unless:
a. Court has doubts as to the soundness of the pleading; and 
b. Court is satisfied that striking out will obviate necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial 
Principle 3: Where Claimant’s SOC is defective only in omitting particulars which Defendant is entitled => Defendant should make application for FBP instead of application to strike out SOC 
- Where claimant’s statement of claim is defective only in not containing particulars to which the defendant is entitled => Defendant should make an application for further and better particulars and not an application to strike out the statement (Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin)

Principles for Ground 1
Principle 1: No evidence is admissible in an application to strike out pleadings under Ground 1 – pleading itself must be so deficient
O 9 r 16(2)
- No evidence is admissible on an application under O 9 r 16(1)(a) 
=> Pleadings itself must be so deficient that it is doomed to fail on the law 
Principle 2: A reasonable cause of action connotes a cause of action which has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered (Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin)
- As long as statement of claim discloses some cause of action or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the mere fact that the case is weak or is not likely to succeed is not a ground for striking out 
- Read only the pleadings => Determine if the Claimant has some chance of success

Example of defective pleadings at law: 
- Tortious claim without loss being proved 
- Claim is time-barred => Can just strike out 

Principles for Ground 2
Principle 1: Abuse of process includes consideration of public policy and interests of justice 

Principle 2: Examples of abuse of process (Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin)
- Where the judicial process is used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation 
- Where a claim is brought for an ulterior or collateral purpose
- Where there are no facts to support a claim 
- Where an identical question is litigated over and over again 

Principle 3: 4 categories of abuse of process (Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs)
- Proceedings which involve a deception on the Court or are fictitious or constitute a mere sham 
- Proceedings where the process of the Court is not being fairly or honestly used but is employed for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper way 
- Proceedings which are manifestly groundless or without foundation or which serve no useful purpose
- Multiple or successive proceedings which cause or are likely to cause improper vexation or oppression 

Principles for Ground 3
Principle 1: The court has inherent jurisdiction to prevent injustice, such as when the claim is plainly or obviously unsustainable (Iskandar bin Rahmat and ors v AG)



*G. SUMMARY JUDGMENT
- Summary process which claimant can use to obtain judgement before trial, in clear cases where C can show that there is not really a defence (by D) to his claims
- Can also be used by the defendant to get a quick judgement on counterclaim brought against C (if C does not really have a defence to the counterclaim)
- Only for OC (outside SAPT, so no need court permission) 
- Not useful for OA because OA is already decided on affidavit 
Non-SAPT matter: Claimant’s application for summary judgement against Defendant 
O 9 r 9(7)(g)
- Application for summary judgement is NOT a matter to be dealt with under SAPT (since it is under the “carve out” list) => Implication: Do not need Court’s approval if application is filed outside SAPT 

Timing
Time of application: Claimant can apply for summary judgement after Defendant files and serves defense 
O 9 r 17(1)
- Claimant may apply for summary judgement against any defendant after the defense had been filed and served in an originating claim --> rationale is to give D an opportunity to set out his defense to C’s claims

OUTER LIMIT OF TIMING: General prohibition against application for summary judgement after expiry of 28 days after date of service of defense (by D)/defense to counterclaim (by C)
O 9 r 17(13)
- Application under O 9 r 17 may not be made after the expiry of 28 days after the date of service of defense (by D) or defense to counterclaim (by C, if D brought a counterclaim)

2-Stage Framework that Court will apply in deciding application for summary judgement 
M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko, Ritzland Investment Pte Ltd v Grace Management & Consultancy Services Pte Ltd
Stage 1: Claimant has to show that he has a prima facie case for summary judgement => Then move to Stage 2
O 9 r 17(1)
- Claimant must show (prima facie) that the Defendant has no defense to
a. A claim; OR 
b. A particular part of a claim; OR 
c. A claim or part of a claim, except as to the amount of any damages claimed 

Stage 2: Defendant will have to establish that there is fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or bona fide defense 
- Show triable issues/question 
- Show that a trial should be held for some other reason 
- Summary judgement will be granted if Defendant can only provide mere assertions which are equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or is inherently improbable in itself

Other Principles 
Principle 1: Summary judgement should not be granted unless it is very clear that there is no defence. (Ling Yew Kong v Teo Vin Li Richard)
- If defence can be described as more than shadowy but less than probable, Defendant should still be granted leave to defend

Principle 2: Summary judgement should not be granted if the case requires Court to determine points of law or construction that may take hours or even days and the citation of many authorities (Ling Yew Kong v Teo Vin Li Richard)
- However, if Defendant’s only defence is a point of law that the Court can see at once that the point is misconceived or plainly unsustainable => Claimant will be entitled to summary judgement 

Procedure for Claimant to apply for summary judgement 
Claimant must file and serve summons (Form 1 or Form 2) and supporting affidavit for summary judgement 

Claimant’s affidavit must contain all evidence necessary or material to the claim
O 9 r 17(2)
- Claimant’s affidavit must contain all evidence that is necessary or material to the claim – *prima facie case must be established in this affidavit --> if prima facie case is made out, burden shifts to defendant to respond by filing reply affidavit

Defendant must file and serve reply to C’s application within 14 days 
O 9 r 17(3)
- If defendant disputes claimant’s application for summary judgement, defendant must: 
* File and serve defendant’s affidavit on the claimant within 14 days after service of the claimant’s application and affidavit 

Defendant’s affidavit must contain all evidence necessary to the defense 
O 9 r 17(4)
- Defendant’s affidavit must contain all evidence that is necessary or material to the defense – *show that D has a fair probability of a defence or that there are triable issues to be determined at trial

Claimant must file and serve reply to D’s reply affidavit within 14 days --> final responsive affidavit by claimant
O 9 r 17(5)
- If claimant disputes anything in the defendant’s affidavit, claimant must: 
* File and serve claimant’s affidavit on the defendant within 14 days after service of the defense’s affidavit 

No further affidavits may be filed without Court’s approval 
O 9 r 17(6)
- No further affidavits may be filed without Court’s approval 

Court’s powers vis-à-vis application for summary judgement
O 9 r 17(7)
- Court may:
a. Dismiss the application for summary judgement (case proceeds to trial); OR 
--> if C is unable to show prima facie case, costs will be made against C

b. Grant permission to defend to the defendant without any conditions (case proceeds to trial); OR 
--> if C shows prima facie case but D’s reply affidavit also has merit, and the court determines more evidence is needed and case should go to trial, costs would depend on who succeeds or fails at the end

c. Grant summary judgement to the claimant (summary judgement granted, no more trial); OR
--> if C has prima facie case and no triable issues or no reasonable defence by D, then summary judgment likely to be granted

d. Grant permission to defend to the defendant with conditions if the defense or any issue raised therein is of a dubious nature (case proceeds to trial)
--> conditional leave to defend: if defense is shadowy/not strong, but slim chance there may be something then, it will allow D to defend at trial but with conditions on D (e.g. payment into court for some form of security to secure the claim amount and ask D to put his money where his mouth is). If D does not comply with conditions, no more trial, ends there and summary judgement is granted against D
Summary judgment is entered where the claimant has a prima facie case and the defendant is unable to satisfactorily answer 

Special Scenario: Court grants Claimant summary judgement but Defendant has counterclaim 
Court can order stay of enforcement of summary judgement (for C’s benefit) until after trial of Defendant’s counterclaim
O 9 r 17(9)
- Court may grant summary judgement but order a stay of enforcement against any defendant until after the trial of the defendant’s counterclaim 

Special Scenario: Defendant is absent at summary judgement hearing
Court may set aside or vary summary judgement granted against absent Defendant 
O 9 r 17(10)
- Court may set aside or vary any summary judgement granted against a defendant who was absent at the hearing 

Summary judgement where D launches counterclaim and C provides defense to counterclaim
Time of application: Defendant can apply for summary judgement against C after Claimant files and serves defense to counterclaim 
O 9 r 17(11)
- Where defendant to an action commenced by OC has served a counterclaim on claimant and claimant has served defense to the counterclaim, the defendant may apply for summary judgement against the claimant on the counterclaim or to a particular part of the counter claim 

Defendant must satisfy that Claimant has no defense to the counterclaim  
O 9 r 17(11)
- Ground: Claimant has no defense to a claim made in the counterclaim or to a particular part of such a claim 

Same procedure as Claimant application for summary judgement against Defendant
O 9 r 17(12) 
- Rules O 9 r 17(2) to O 9 r 17(10) apply with necessary modifications:
* Procedure same 
Difference between striking out defence vs summary judgment 
- Striking out defence – the focus is on the defence (pleading), whether it is legally and factually sustainable 
- In application for summary judgment, there must first be a prima facie case established for the claimant. Only when there is a prima facie case does the defendant need to file a reply affidavit 




*H. DECISION ON QUESTIONS OF LAW OR CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 
- Similar to summary judgement in that it is targeted to reach a quick judgement
- Application to Court for Court to decide question of law or construction of documents WITHOUT A FULL TRIAL

SAPT matter – Application to determine questions of law or construction of documents 
O 9 r 9(4)(j)
- Application to determine questions of law or construction of documents is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT

Court’s power to decide question of law or construction of documents 
Court’s own accord or Party’s application => Court can decide questions of law/construction of documents without trial or hearing facts
O 9 r 19(1)
- Upon a party’s application or on the Court’s accord, the Court may decide any question of law or the construction of any document arising in any action without a trial or hearing on the facts, whether or not such decision will fully determine the action 
--> i.e. this question to be decided need not be the ONLY thing that needs to be determined in the case

United Overseas Bank Ltd v Lippo Marina Collection Pte Ltd
- A free-standing question of law can be summarily determined even though such determination does not dispose of the entire action 
- Requirements in UOB still likely to apply (SO STILL REFER TO THE FACTORS BELOW), but in the context of the court’s discretion (no longer as a threshold requirement)

If the court’s decision would fully determine the matter
If O 9 r 19(2) Requirement + 4 UOB Requirements are satisfied => Court can give judgement or dismiss the entire action 
O 9 r 19(2)
- Court may give judgement or dismiss action or make any order that is appropriate where:
* The Court’s decision in O 9 r 19(1) fully determines (subject only to any appeal) the entire matter or any claim or issue therein

United Overseas Bank Ltd v Lippo Marina Collection Pte Ltd 
- 4 requirements for judgement/dismissal of entire action: --> these were considered threshold conditions under ROC 2014, but no longer in ROC 2021
1. Requirement 1: Defendant has entered appearance in an action; --> I.E. D MUST FILE NOTICE OF INTENTION TO CONTEST
2. Requirement 2: Parties have an opportunity to be heard on the question of law/construction of documents;
3. Requirement 3: Question of law/construction of documents suitable to be determined without full trial of action
a. There are no questions that raise factual issues – a question that raises factual issues is NOT suitable for determination without a full trial  
b. There are no novel issue of law that has considerable public importance 
c. A question that raises complex issues of law may be suitable for determination without a trial BUT if it’s a novel issue of law that has considerable public importance, then a full trial might be more suitable
4. Requirement 4: Determination of question of law/construction of documents fully determines entire cause of action: A determination of question of law/construction of documents will fully determine the entire cause of action, claim or issue 


Judgments on admission
- Another way to get a judgement without a trial => By using an admission from the other party

SAPT matter – Application for judgement on admission of facts  
O 9 r 9(4)(j)
- Application for judgement on admission of facts is a matter to be dealt with under SAPT

Court’s power to grant judgement on admission 
Party’s application orally or in writing => Court can give judgement based on admissions of fact in party’s pleadings or documents 
O 9 r 18(2)
- Court may, on application made orally or in writing, give judgement on admissions of fact made by a party in the party’s pleadings or other documents 
Admissions must be viewed as a whole, be clear and equivocal 
Mycitydeal Ltd (trading as Groupon UK) v Villas International Property Pte Ltd
- Standard of admissions: Admissions must be viewed as a whole (cannot be cherry-picked) and they must be clear and equivocal 

Third Party and similar Proceedings 
- When defendant wants to bring a 3rd party into any OS/OC started by the plaintiff against the defendant 

Objective of 3rd party proceedings 
Chancery Law Corp v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 1024 
- 2 objectives:
1. Enable parties to raise all issues relating to the subject matter of the hearing in one set of proceedings
=> Avoids delay and unnecessary costs resulting from multiple actions
2. Avoid inconsistency between judicial decisions if common issues are litigated in separated proceedings 

Explanation 


If claimant brings a claim against df1, he can join df2 later 
There are situations where df1 has counterclaim against claimant (blue arrow) – df1 is claimant in counterclaim 
Df1 can bring counterclaim against a party who is not party to the original proceedings – this is the 2nd df in counterclaim 

Step 1: Defendant must satisfy any of the 3 grounds to issue a 3rd party notice  
Defendant must satisfy any of 3 grounds to issue a 3rd party notice 
O 10 r 1(1)
- Defendant in any action will have grounds to issue a 3rd party notice if defendant: 
a. Ground 1: Defendant claims indemnity from 3rd party: Claims against a person not already a party to the action any contribution or indemnity; OR 
b. Ground 2: Defendant claims remedy from 3rd party similar to Claimant’s claimed remedy: Claims against such a person any relief or remedy relating to or connected with the original subject matter of the action and substantially the same as some relief or remedy claimed by the claimant (e.g. contractor got sued for something that was subcontractor’s fault) 
c. Ground 3: Defendant requires any question relating to subject matter to be determined between Claimant, Defendant and 3rd party: Requires that any question or issue relating to or connected with the original subject matter of the action should be determined not only as between the claimant and defendant but also as between either or both of them and a person not already a party to the action 

Step 2: Defendant assess if Court’s permission if required to issue 3rd party notice  
Court’s permission NOT required if: (1) Claimant begun action by OC + (2) Defendant issues 3rd party notice before serving defense on Claimant

- Application for permission to issue a 3rd party notice must be supported by an affidavit stating:
a. Nature of claim made by claimant in action 
b. Stage which proceedings in action have reached
c. Nature of the claim made by the applicant or particulars of the question or issue required to be determined (as the case may be) and the facts on which the proposed 3rd party notice is based; and 
d. Name and address of the person against whom the 3rd party notice is to be issued 

Court order granting permission may contain directions as to specified period for issuance of 3rd party notice
O 10 r 3(1)
- Order granting permission to defendant to issue a 3rd party notice may contain directions as to the period within which the 3rd party notice is to be issued 

Step 3: Defendant serves 3rd party notice to 3rd party => For OC matters, 3rd party must serve notice of intention to contest within 14 days of receiving notice
Procedure for defendant to issue a 3rd party notice to 3rd party 
After filing notice of intention to contest (if main OC) => Defendant can issue 3rd party notice in Form 20 or Form 21 to 3rd party => 3rd party notice with contents in O 10 r 1(1)

Step 4: Defendant must serve summons on 3rd party and apply to Court for 3rd party directions  
Procedure for Defendant to serve summons on 3rd party and apply to Court for directions 
For main OC – After 3rd party files and serves notice of intention to contest in Form 10 => Then Defendant must serve summons in Form 23 on all other parties to the action => Defendant must also serve on Court to apply for directions 
For main OA – Anytime after Defendant issues 3rd party notice => Defendant must serve summons in Form 23 on all other parties to the action => Defendant must also serve on Court to apply for directions 
O 10 r 4(1)
- Defendant who issued 3rd party notice, must by summons in Form 23, serve on all other parties to the action, to apply to the Court for directions 
- If action was begun by OC, then application to Court for directions must not be made before 3rd party files and serves a notice of intention to contest or not contest in Form 10 

Procedure if Defendant fails to serve summons on 3rd party and fails to apply to Court for directions 
For main OC – If Defendant fails to serve summons on 3rd party => 3rd party must file notice of intention to contest => After 14 days, 3rd party may serve summons in Form 23 on all other parties to the action => 3rd party must also serve on Court to apply for order to set aside the 3rd party notice 
For main OA – If Defendant fails to serve summons on 3rd party => 14 days after 3rd party receives 3rd party notice => 3rd party may serve summons in Form 23 on all other parties to the action => 3rd party must also serve on Court to apply for order to set aside the 3rd party notice 
Failure of defendant to serve summons on 3rd party 
O 10 r 4(2)
- If defendant does not serve summons on 3rd party, 3rd party may:

b. In an action begun by OA, after 14 days after serving notice of notice on 3rd party => By summons in Form 23 to be served on all other parties to the action, apply to Court for directions for an order to set aside 3rd party notice

Step 5: Court’s powers when issuing directions
On Defendant’s application for Court directions => Court may make certain orders 
O 10 r 4(3)
- On application for directions under O 10 r 4, Court may: 
a. If liability of 3rd party to defendant is established on hearing => Order judgement to be entered against the 3rd party in favor of defendant 
b. Order any claim, question or issue in 3rd party notice to be tried in such manner as the Court may direct 
c. Dismiss application and terminate proceedings on 3rd party notice and may do so either before or after any judgement has been signed by the claimant against the defendant 

On Defendant’s application for Court directions => Court may make other orders 
O 10 r 4(4)
- On application for directions under O 10 r 4, Court may: 
a. Give 3rd party permission to defend action, either alone or jointly with any defendant, upon such terms as may be just, or to appear at the trial or hearing and to take such part in the trial or hearing as may be just
b. Make orders as appear to the Court proper for having the rights and liabilities of parties most conveniently determined and enforced and as to the extent to which the 3rd party is to be bound by any judgement or decision in the action 



*I. PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 
- Parties in an action commenced by an OC must produce documents relevant to the dispute to each other
- General production (Various kinds)

General Provisions on Court’s power in relation to production of documents 
Order 11 disclosure provisions do not affect any agreement of parties or Court’s power to allow discovery in the interests of justice  - i.e. O 11 only sets out the BASIC REQUIREMENTS of the parties’ obligation to produce and exchange documents, so it can be a higher requirement (via agreement or court order)
O 11 r 1(1)
- Order 11 does not affect: 
a. Any agreement that the parties or any set of parties may make to broaden the scope of such obligations; OR 
b. Court’s power to allow a broader scope of discovery where it is in the interests of justice to do so 
*Court must have regard to O 11 r 1(2) principles when exercising powers under Order 11
O 11 r 1(2)
- In exercising power under Order 11, Court must bear in mind the following principles:
a. Claimant must sue and proceed on strength of his case and not weakness of defendant’s case; and
b. Party who sues or is sued does not give up privacy and confidentiality in any document or communication.

Court’s power to broaden scope of discovery in the interests of justice

- Where there is an application for a broader scope of discovery, the 2 principles in O 11 r 1(2) does not apply and Court must have regard only to Ideals and to O 11 r 1(4) 

Production of documents (Exercised during First Case Conference)
*1st stage: Initial Orders for production (old “general discovery”) – takes place before SAPT
Part 1: After Court makes Initial Order during case conference => Parties have 14 days to exchange a list of and copy of documents in their possession or control  
Where AEICs are ordered before document production – typically no need for any general production. But there may still be specific production after the AEICs are exchanged (as part of SAPT)!

Where AEICs are ordered before document production, typically no need for general production. 
- This is because AEICs will already contain a list of documents that the party wishes to rely on 
- There may be situations where parties agree to have general production despite the AEIC 
- Specific production occurs after AEICs are exchanged 

O 11 r 2(1)
- Court can make an Initial Order for production of documents at a case conference 
- Parties must within 14 days after the date of the case conference, exchange a list of and a copy of the documents in their possession or control which fall within the scope of disclosure

Definition of “known adverse documents” 
O 11 r 2(2)
- “Known adverse documents” includes documents which a party ought reasonably to know are adverse to the party’s case 

Part 3: Parties need not exchange common documents
O 11 r 2(4)
- To comply with O 11 r 2(1), it is NOT necessary for parties to exchange documents common to them that are in their possession or control to avoid duplication and to save costs 

Part 4: Consequences of non-compliance 
O 11 r 2(5)
- Parties may not rely on any document that was not exchanged or produced under Order 11 --> unless you get permission of the court

Adverse costs orders for failure to comply 
O 21 r 4(d)
- That party has failed to comply with any order of court, any relevant pre?action protocol or any practice direction.

Other consequences under O 11 r 7
O 11 r 7
- If any party fails to comply with any order made by the Court under Order 11, the Court may:
a. Order that action be dismissed or defense be struck out and judgement entered: Order that the action be dismissed or that the defense be struck out and judgement be entered accordingly 
b. Draw any adverse inference: Draw an adverse inference or make any such order as the Court deems fit
c. Punish party for contempt of Court => Unless party show that he was not notified: Punish that party for contempt of Court if the order has been served on the party’s solicitor => But it is open to that party to show that that party was not notified or did not know about the order

*2nd stage: Order for production of requested documents (old “specific discovery”)
SAPT matter: Production of Documents  
O 9 r 9(4)(k)
- Application for production of documents is matter to be dealt with under SAPT
Not limited to OC, but not commonly used in an OA situation 
NOTE BEFORE MAKING SAPT APPLICATION FOR SPECIFIC DISCOVERY – YOU SHOULD FIRST WRITE TO THE OTHER SIDE WITH A LETTER AND REQUEST THE DOCUMENTS AND EXPLAIN WHY – only if the other side ignores or rejects then consider filing application for specific discovery

Part 1: Requesting party can make request to Court => Requesting party must properly identify requested documents and show materiality of requested documents => Court may make orders for production of requested documents 
O 11 r 3(1)
- Court may order any party to produce the original or a copy of a specific document or class of documents in the party’s possession or control, if the requesting party:

* The fact that requested documents are not in party’s possession or control; and
* Whether that party had such possession or control previously; and
* If so, when that party had parted with possession or control of requested documents 

Special Scenario: If AEICs are ordered to be exchanged before exchange of documents, the Court cannot order production of requested documents until parties have complied with Court’s order to exchange AEICs
O 11 r 3(3)
- If Court has ordered parties to exchange AEICs before exchanging documents => Court cannot order production of requested documents until parties have complied with Court’s order to exchange AEICs
- Normally where AEICs are ordered to be exchanged before exchange of documents, there will NOT be a second stage of discovery

Order for production of any document (against a party or non-party) [this is post-action, cf pre-action under O 11 r 11]
Court on its own accord and at any time=> Order any party or non-party to produce a copy of any document in party/non-party’s possession or control
O 11 r 4
- Court may of its own accord and at any time, order any party or non-party to produce a copy of any document that is in the person’s possession or control 
- Subject to O 11 r 5, r 8 and r 9

* O 11 r 8: Privileged documents
* O 11 r 9: Confidential documents 

*General restrictions on order for production of certain documents – both for general and specific production
No production of “train of inquiry” documents unless special case
O 11 r 5(1)
- Court must not order production of any document that is not material in itself but merely leads a party on a train of inquiry to other documents 
- Default is no, except in a special case 

No production of private correspondences unless special case
O 11 r 5(2)
- Court must not order production of any document that is part of a party’s private or internal correspondence whether in paper form or in an electronic format (e.g. electronic mail, short message service, instant messaging service) 
- Except: --> 2 situations where private correspondences CAN be produced
a. It is a special case; OR 
b. Such correspondences are known adverse documents (I.E. EVEN IF DOCS ARE INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL, IF THEY ARE KNOWN BY THE POSSESSOR TO BE ADVERSE TO THEM, IT MUST BE DISCLOSED, e.g. private correspondence contains an admission) 

No production of documents subject to privilege or where contrary to public interest 
O 11 r 5(3)
- Court must not order production of any document which is: 
* Subject to privilege (e.g. legal professional privilege); OR 
* Where its production would be contrary to public interest 

GENERAL RULE: No order for production of privileged documents unless privileged party consents or Court approves 
O 11 r 8(1)
- Document which was at any time subject to privilege must not be relied on unless the party entitled to the privilege consents or the Court approves 
O 11 r 8(2)

O 11 r 9(2)
- A confidential document does not lose its confidentiality even if it was disclosed or taken inadvertently or unlawfully by anyone.

Pre-action/non-party production of documents 
Why? 
- To identify possible parties to proceedings 
- To trace party’s property 
- Any other lawful purpose 

Covered more comprehensively above – see here 

O 11 r 11(1) – The Court may order the production of documents and information before the commencement of proceedings or against a nonparty to identify possible parties to any proceedings, to enable a party to trace the party’s property or for any other lawful purpose, in the interests of justice.

Non-party is entitled to reasonable costs
O 11 r 11(3)
- A non-party is entitled to all reasonable costs arising out of such an application 
- “Non-party” includes the respondent to a pre-action application, who is not a party yet 

Miscellaneous Issues
*Continuing duty to produce 
When Court orders production of document => Document only comes into party’s possession or control during proceedings => Party must produce the document within 14 days 
O 11 r 6
- Where Court makes an order under O 11 r 2, O 11 r 3 or O 11 r 4, the party required to produce documents will remain under a duty to produce any documents within 14 days after that document comes into the party’s possession or control at any times in the course of proceedings 
* O 11 r 2: Initial Order for production 
* O 11 r 3: Order for production of requested documents
* O 11 r 4: Order for production of any document (party or non-party) 

*Consequences of non-compliance with order for production 
Court may make certain orders
O 11 r 7
- If any party fails to comply with any order made by the Court under Order 11, the Court may:
a. Order that action be dismissed or defense be struck out and judgement entered; --> this is very serious so requires a serious breach
b. Draw any adverse inference or make any such order as deemed fit;
c. Punish party for contempt of Court if order has been served on his solicitor => Unless party show that he was not notified or did not know about the order;
d. Order that party may not rely on document unless the Court approves.
Practical matter – how do you know if the other party is not disclosing certain documents? 
- Documents normally leave trails – they are referred to in other correspondence etc. 
- Or documents that are required to be kept under certain laws, e.g. Companies Act 
- Then you can go and complain to court for non-disclosure, or you can ask court to draw adverse inference 

Adverse costs orders for failure to comply 
O 21 r 4(d)
- That party has failed to comply with any order of court, any relevant pre?action protocol or any practice direction.

Confidentiality NOT a defense against disclosure order
O 11 r 9(1)
- A party who was required by any Court order to produce documents may not withhold or object to the production of any document on the ground that the document is confidential 
- Note – this applies to all production of documents under O 11 
- See also O 11 r 8 (above) which is another relevant rule on confidentiality 

*Restriction on use of documents produced in other proceedings 
Document produced under Order 11 must NOT be relied on in other proceedings => Unless party who produced document consents or Court otherwise approves
O 11 r 10(1)
- Any document produced under Order 11 or by compulsion of law in Court proceedings must not be relied on in other proceedings by other parties or non-parties 
- Except:
* Party who produced document consents
* Court otherwise approves 

O 11 r 10(2): APPLYING FOR EXPRESS COURT ORDER TO PROHIBIT USE OF A DOCUMENT
- Party who use or produced any document in a case may apply to the Court to prohibit the use of such documents for any purpose other than for that case 

Inspection of originals upon request 
Any party can request to inspect original of any document produced => Opposing party must arrange mutually convenient time and place for investigation  
O 11 r 12(1)
- If a party requests to inspect the original of any document produced, the party who produced the document must arrange a mutually convenient time and place for the inspection to take place 

Inspection within 14 days after request 
O 11 r 12(2)
- Inspection must take place within 14 days after request unless parties otherwise agree


Witnesses 
*A. FACT WITNESSES AND AEICS 
*General rule: Trial must be decided on basis of AEICs (affidavits of evidence-in-chief), cross-ex, re-ex, oral or written subs 
O 15 r 16(1)
- General rule: The trial in an OC, assessment of damages or value and taking of accounts must be decided on the basis of: 
* The witnesses’ AEICs;
* Cross-examination;
* Re-examination; and 
* Oral or written submissions.

- The AEIC is the general method for adducing a witness’ testimony at trial. The scheme of adducing evidence-in-chief by way of AEICs is designed to achieve a fair and expeditious disposal of proceedings, to save costs and to eliminate any element of surprise 
--> witnesses submit written AEICs and they would then be subject to cross-examination to test their statements under oath

*Exception: Dispensation with written AEIC to use oral EIC only 
O 15 r 16(2)
- In a special case, Court may allow a witness’s EIC to be given orally instead of by AEIC.
- E.g. When an order to attend court is to compel a witness to testify at trial.
- E.g. there is a last minute witness before trial and there is no time to get their written AEIC, so need to compel them to give oral EIC at trial instead
Application for Court’s leave to dispense with AEIC are heard inter partes => Opposing party can object to application for such leave
Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Cooperative Ltd 
- Objecting party must raise all objections in the dispensation application rather than to delay and mount an attack later on 
- If objecting party does not object, then he has to live with the decision later on 
- Reason: Judicial policy against trial by ambush which would severely disrupt a party’s ability to plan its case 

*AEIC can only be used if witness attends court for cross-examination 
Filing and service of AEIC does not automatically mean it can be used
O 15 r 16(3) 
- AEIC may not be used if the maker does not attend Court for cross-examination 
- Unless the parties otherwise agree  


Contents of AEIC 
AEIC must contain all material facts

- Expert is a person with scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge based on training, study or experience 

Sanum Investments Limited v ST Group Co Ltd – Alleged foreign law expert not considered expert as he did not have enough experience
- Court found that a foreign law expert put forward by a party did not qualify as an expert under the Rules of Court
- The foreign law expert was called in to provide his opinion on Lao law which is the governing law of the agreement but: 
a. Foreign law expert did not formally practice as a lawyer in Laos and was only a party representative who files petitions, submits evidence, lodges appeals and argues cases 
b. His area of practice was not clear 
c. It was not known how many cases he was involved in 
d. He only began practicing recently (5 years)

3 requirements for Court approval 
O 12 r 2(2)
- Parties must consider: 
* Requirement 1: Whether expert evidence will contribute materially to the determination of any issue that relates to scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge 
* Requirement 2: Whether such issue can be resolved by an agreed statement of fact or by submissions based on mutually agreed materials – i.e. issue cannot be resolved by some form of agreement between the parties or based on mutually agreed material, then can use expert evidence

O 12 r 2(3)
- Court must not approve the use of expert evidence unless it will contribute materially to the determination of any issue in the case and the issue cannot be resolved in the manner stated in O 12 r 2(2)
O 12 r 2(4) --> this is a continuing power of the court – even after court has originally approved, it can later disallow

*C. ORDER TO ATTEND COURT/PRODUCE DOCUMENTS – SUBPOENAS 
- TLDR: Party can request for an order to compel any person who is in a position to give relevant evidence to come forward and give oral evidence or produce documents 

Step 1: Party must request for Registrar to issue an “Order to Attend Court” or “Order to Produce Documents”   
Party must file Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents in Form 29 when requesting Registrar to issue it
O 15 r 4(1)
- Parties may request Registrar to issue an order to attend Court or an order to produce documents in Form 29 to any witness, stating whether the witness is to give oral evidence or to produce documents or both

Para 76 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021
- Party must file order to attend court in the manner and form set out in Form 29 of Appendix A of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021

Contents of Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents in O 15 r 4(2)
O 15 r 4(2)
- Order to attend Court or Order to produce documents must state:
* The requesting party,
* Whether the witness is to give oral evidence or to produce documents or both.

Step 2: If approved, Registrar will seal the Order to Attend Court => Order to Attend Court will be considered issued when sealed
Order to attend Court issued when sealed 
Para 76 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021
- An order to attend Court is issued when it is sealed by an officer of the Registry 

Step 3: Requesting party must serve Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents on the person 
Requesting Party must personally serve the order at least 28 days before hearing
O 15 r 4(3)
- Order to attend Court or an Order to produce documents must be served by the requesting party on the witness by personal service in Singapore at least 28 days before the hearing 

Service out of jurisdiction is NOT allowed: Cannot subpoena a witness who is out of jurisdiction
- O 15 r 4(3) expressly provides that Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents can only be personally served on a witness in Singapore 
- Service out of jurisdiction is not allowed => Implication is that you cannot subpoena a witness who is out of jurisdiction 

Step 4: Any person/Registrar’s own accord can apply to Registrar to revoke the Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents --> this is when the Registrar can consider the relevance, necessity and materiality of documents
Any person/Registrar’s own accord make application to Registrar => Registrar can revoke Order
O 15 r 4(4)
- Upon application by any person or the Registrar’s own motion => Registrar may revoke an Order to attend Court or an Order to produce documents or both 
- Can the witness/non-party himself apply to revoke the order? Case Lao Holdings suggests that the equivalent rule under the old ROC would permit the witness himself to make an application to set aside the subpoena. The rule has not changed from the old ROC, so this same principle should apply. 

Principle applying to all Orders to Attend Court/Produce Documents: Subpoena should not be used frivolously or to embarrass the party being subpoenaed 
Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa 
- Subpoena should not be used frivolously, in a scandalous manner or issued without basis or reason so as to embarrass the party being subpoenaed 

Principle applying to Order to Attend Court (subpoena to testify): should be granted if witnesses were disinterested and in a position to give relevant and crucial oral and documentary evidence 
Basil Herman Anthony v Premier Security Cooperative Ltd 
- Outcome of the case turned on key events which witnesses were in a position to give oral and documentary evidence
- Witnesses were disinterested parties and were more likely to give credible evidence 

Principles applying to Order to Produce Documents (subpoena for documents) 
Principle 1: Orders to Produce Documents must satisfy 2 requirements
The Lao People’s Democratic Republic v Sanum Investments Ltd 
- Requirement 1: What is sought in a subpoena to produce documents must be relevant, material and necessary for the fair disposal of the matter 
- Requirement 2: Subpoena to produce documents would be an improper use of the procedure if it amounts to an order for discovery (i.e. it cannot amount to an order for discovery, it must have sufficient precision in identifying particular documents, rather than being too generic)

Principle 2: Subpoena for production of documents would be set aside if for clearly irrelevant documents or a collateral purpose 
BVU v BVX 
- Held: Documents sought were unnecessary for the determination of the case and the subpoena was a backdoor to reopen an arbitrated dispute and would amount to an abuse of process 

The Lao People’s Democratic Republic v Sanum Investments Ltd 
- Non-party was compelled by subpoena to produce documents in aid of arbitration 
- Issues: 
a. Whether subpoena lacked sufficient precision in identifying the particular documents required to be produced i.e. whether it would amount to an attempt to obtain discovery against a 3rd party
b. Whether documents sought were sufficiently relevant and material to the arbitration and whether they were necessary for the disposal of the matter
- Held: The documents sought were highly relevant and material to the issues in the arbitration => Subpoena was sufficiently precise to enable the party being subpoenaed to know what was required of him

Step 5: Dissatisfied party can appeal against Registrar’s decision on the subpoena
Dissatisfied party can appeal against Registrar’s decision => Appeal to GDHC or District Judge 
O 15 r 4(5)
- Any party who is dissatisfied with any decision of the Registrar may apply to a Judge sitting in the General Division or a District Judge for a review of the Registrar’s decision 

Dissatisfied party must make appeal application by summons supported by affidavit within 14 days after Registrar’s decision 
Appeal process 
O 15 r 4(6)
- Appellant must make application by summons supported by an affidavit within 14 days after the Registrar’s initial decision 

Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents will have effect until conclusion of appeal hearing
O 15 r 4(7)
- Order to attend Court or Order to produce documents continues to have effect until conclusion of hearing 

Step 6: Instructions for person subject to Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents 
Person subject to Order entitled to claim reasonable compensation for time and expense from requesting party 
O 15 r 4(9) 
- A witness who complies with an Order to attend Court or an Order to produce documents is entitled to claim reasonable compensation for his time and expenses in complying with the order from the requesting party upon request 

Non-compliance with Order: Liable for contempt of Court 
- Liable for contempt of Court

Special instructions for Order to produce documents
Implied undertaking by requesting party in Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd applies to documents obtained 
- Requesting party is under an implied undertaking to not use documents produced for any purpose other than for pursuing the action 
- Requesting party cannot use documents produced for any collateral or ulterior purpose 
Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd
- Parties will be taken to have given an implied undertaking to the Court to not use documents produced under an Order to produce documents for a collateral or ulterior purpose
- Non-compliance: Amounts to a breach of undertaking given to the Court and can result in liability for contempt of Court. Breach can be restrained by injunction too. 
Reason:
- Riddick undertaking balances between the interests of: 
a. Full and complete disclosure in the interests of justice 
b. Protection against intrusion of privacy 

Person subject to Order to Produce Documents need NOT attend Court personally if documents produced are in accordance with order
O 15 r 4(8)
- A witness served with an Order to produce documents need not attend court personally if he ensures that all the documents required are produced in accordance with the order to produce documents
-

O 9 r 24(1)
- Where it is necessary in the interests of justice to record the evidence of any witness in or out of Singapore before a trial, a party may apply to the Court to make an order for pre-trial examination 

Rules governing Pre-trial examination 
Pre-trial examination rules same as normal trial rules
O 9 r 24(6)
- A pre?trial examination in Singapore must be before a Judge or the Registrar and must be conducted according to the rules governing trials

Rules for Order for pre-trial examination same as rules for Order to Attend Court/Produce Documents
O 9 r 24(7)
- Where an order for pre?trial examination in Singapore has been made, the attendance of the witness before the examiner in Singapore and the production by the witness of any document at the examination may be enforced by an order to attend court and an order to produce documents in like manner as the attendance of a witness and the production by a witness of a document at a trial may be enforced.

Requesting party must use Order to Attend Court and provide Registrar issuing Order with details of the prison
O 15 r 4(10) 
- If witness is a person confined in prison and requesting party requests Order to attend Court to be served on witness => Requesting party must include in his letter (the request being made to the Registrar to issue a Form 29 order):

*What if witness wants to attend trial by live video or television link evidence? 
Step 1: Requesting party must trigger Court’s discretion by satisfying any ground under s62A(1) EA:
S62A(1) of Evidence Act
- A person may, with permission of the Court, give evidence through a live video or live television link in any proceedings other than proceedings in a criminal matter or proceedings for contempt of court (i.e. can only be used for civil proceedings) if: 
a. Ground 1: Witness below 18 years’ old; OR
b. Ground 2: It was expressly agreed between parties; OR 
c. Ground 3: Witness is outside Singapore; OR 
d. Ground 4: It is in interests of justice. 

Step 2: Requesting Party must satisfy Court that the circumstances warrant the Court to grant permission
If Ground 3: Witness outside Singapore => Court will have regard to circumstances under s62A(2)
S62A(2) of Evidence Act 
- In considering whether to grant permission for a witness outside Singapore to give evidence by live or live television link under s62A, the Court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following: 
a. Reasons why witness unable to give evidence in Singapore; 
b. Administrative and technical facilities and arrangements for witness to give evidence overseas; 
c. Any unfair prejudice to any party to the proceedings; 
d. Any other matter prescribed by rules made under s62A(9) 

If any Ground => Court will have regard to s62A(5) – Fairness to parties
S62A(5) of Evidence Act
- Fairness to parties: The Court is not to make an order under s62A or include a particular provision in such an order, if to do so would be inconsistent with the Court’s duty to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly to the parties to the proceedings

Principle 1: Court would consider a few other factors under case law 
- Court would consider factors such as: (Sonica Industries Ltd) 
a. Reasons why the witness cannot give evidence in Singapore
b. Whether evidence of witnesses were material to the issue at hand 
c. Efforts taken to secure witness’s presence in Singapore 

Principle 2: Applicants should not blindly cite the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason why a witness is unable to testify physically at trial (Wang Xiaopu v Koh Mui Lee)
- COVID-19 situation has stabilized and close attention must be paid to the precise facts explaining exactly why the witness is unable to travel, mere generalizations about travel disruptions brought on by COVID-19 are insufficient 
- Risk of contracting COVID-19 is irrelevant unless it was shown that the witness had health-related issues that put him at risk of serious complications if he contracted COVID-19 

Principle 3: Unwillingness of witness to travel does not preclude grant of permission => Court may still grant permission if other circumstances exist 
- Even though s62A(2) seems to suggest that the unwillingness of witness to travel is not a relevant reason to grant permission to give evidence by live video or live television link => Recent cases seem to suggest that the Court is willing to still grant permission to give evidence by live video or television link if:
a. Party has no control of the witness (Anil Singh Gurm) 
b. Witness’s evidence is material (Anil Singh Gurm) 
c. There will be unfair prejudice if permission is not granted and no unfair prejudice if permission is granted (Sonica Industries Ltd) 
Examples of case law:
Permission granted: Even though reason is based on witness’s unwillingness => There will be no unfair prejudice is permission is granted and there will be unfair prejudice if permission is not granted 
Sonica Industries Ltd v Fu Yu Manufacturing Ltd 
- Pf sought leave for 2 witnesses to give evidence by live video
- Held: Leave granted in respect of 1 witness 
1. Permission granted for 1st witness: 
a. There was no way Pf could compel the 1st witness to travel to Singapore to give evidence and Court was satisfied that Pf had made the necessary attempts to secure his presence but without any success 
b. 1st witness’s evidence is material and relevant and there would be prejudice to the Pf if permission was not granted 
c. Df would not be prejudiced if permission was granted
(i) Pf identified the particular facts and issues which could be proved by 1st witness
(ii) Statement of 1st witness’s evidence had been furnished to the Dfs and Dfs would not be taken by surprise
(iii) Dfs can cross-examine the 1st witness through live video
(iv) 1st witness’s evidence is not very complicated or technical  
2. Permission not granted for 2nd witness:
a. 2nd witness’s evidence was peripheral to the main issue and no prejudice if permission not granted
Peter Rogers May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian
- If sufficient reason is given why the actual physical presence of foreign witnesses cannot be effected, a court should lean in favour of permitting video-linked evidence in lieu of the normal rule of physical testimony. Sufficient reason ought to be a relatively low threshold to overcome and should be assessed with a liberal and pragmatic latitude. 
- If a witness is not normally resident within a jurisdiction, that may itself afford a sufficient reason with a view to minimising costs. 
- On the other hand, if for instance the evidence of an important foreign witness cannot be voluntarily obtained by video link, this could tip the balance in favour of hearing the matter in the foreign jurisdiction where the witness resides so the witness can be compelled to give evidence there. Even then, the importance of that witness personally giving evidence as a factor may not be critical if deposition taking is available. 
- The relative gravity of the witness personally giving evidence must invariably be weighed and measured against the nature and relevance of the proposed evidence

Permission granted: Witness subject to travel restriction + Difficulties obtaining permission even though steps were taken to do so + Poor health 
Permission NOT granted: Witness looking for convenience 
Bachmeer Capital Limited v Ong Chi Ching 
- Applicant sought leave for 2 witnesses to give evidence by live video 
- Held: Leave granted in respect of 1 witness 
1. Permission granted for 1st witness
a. 1st witness was subject to a travel restriction. There were difficulties obtaining permission from relevant Chinese authorities even though steps were taken to do so.  
b. 1st witness was in poor health 
2. Permission not granted for 2nd witness
a. 2nd witness was able to attend trial physical but was simply hoping to have a more convenient means of testifying 
Anil Singh Gurm v J S Yeh & Co 
- Applicant sought leave to give evidence by video link testimony 
- Held: Leave granted 
1. Generally s62A only covers situations where a witness is unable to physically give evidence due to circumstances outside their control => Currently, witness was unwilling to enter Singapore for fear of arrest => However, this did not preclude the Court from granting permission 

2. Court will consider whether the party has control over the witness => If party has no control over the witness and has made all reasonable attempts to secure the witness’s attendance => Court is more likely to grant permission 

3. Witness can give material evidence on key factual issues => Denial of permission would mean no evidence would be adduced => Appellant would be prejudiced if he was deprived of opportunity to call witness but Respondent would not be prejudiced if witness gives evidence by video link => Court is more likely to grant permission 

- Note Policy Considerations: 
1. Party’s right to access to justice and his entitlement to put forward the best possible case and relevant evidence
2. Court should not facilitate a person’s attempt to evade justice 

- Paragraph 46(HC): “a witness cannot raise a valid reason for not attending in person, and instead for giving evidence by video link, his professed desire to avoid the normal processes of the law.”
Permission NOT granted: witnesses unwilling + no steps were taken by the applicant for special permission from ICA
Sahara Energy International Pte Ltd v Chu Said Thong 
- Applicant sought leave for 2 witnesses to give evidence by video-link
- Held: Permission not granted 
1. The 2 witnesses were unwilling but not unable to come to Singapore to give evidence => Even though the applicant cited COVID-19 travel related restrictions, the applicant did not even try to apply for special permission from the Singapore authorities for the 2 witnesses to enter Singapore 
2. Court made the following orders: 
a. Applicant will apply to ICA for permission for 2 witnesses to come to Singapore and if they need to be quarantined, they will serve their 14 days’ quarantine which should be completed before commencement of trial 
b. Applicant will be given liberty to apply for live video evidence in the event the 2 witnesses are still in quarantine when the trial commences 
c. Unless Applicant takes the above steps, the applicant’s claim will be dismissed with costs ordered against the applicant 
Permission NOT granted: court cautioned against blindly citing the pandemic as a reason as to why a witness is unable to testify physically at trial
Wang Xiaopu v Koh Mui Lee 
- Applicant sought leave for Wang to give evidence by video-link
- Held: Permission not granted 
1. Wang cited COVID-19 travel disruptions => However, COVID-19 situation has stabilized and mere generalizations about travel disruptions brought on by COVID-19 pandemic are insufficient => Need to pay attention to the precise facts explaining exactly why the witness is unable to travel
2. Wang cited substantial risk of contracting COVID-19 => However, it is irrelevant unless it was shown that Wang had health-related issues that put her at risk of serious complications if she contracted COVID-19 
3. Even though safety issues are important, Court will balance safety issues with the need to ensure justice and equity of the case 
4. Court will not allow parties to manipulate prevailing situation to their advantage and compromise a fair hearing 

Step 3: Court can grant permission for witness to give evidence by live video or television link subject to certain orders 
S62A(3) of Evidence Act 
- Court may, in granting permission under s62A(1), make an order on all or any of the following matters:
a. Person to be with witness (accompanying them) 
b. Person to NOT be with witness while he is giving evidence
c. Persons in courtroom who must be seen and/or heard by witness
d. Persons in courtroom who must NOT be seen/heard by witness
e. Witness must be seen/heard by persons in courtroom
f. Stages of proceedings during which a specified part of the order is to have effect
g. Method of operating live video or live television link system including compliance with such minimum technical standards as may be determined by the Chief Justice 
h. Any other order the Court considers necessary in the interests of justice 

Step 4: Court can revoke, suspend or vary order granted under certain circumstances 
S62A(4) of Evidence Act 
- Court may revoke, suspend or vary an order under s62A if:
a. Live video stops working and unreasonable delay before it works or becomes available; OR
b. Necessary for fairness to parties; OR
c. Necessary for witness to do something physically in Court: so that the witness can identify a person or a thing or so that the witness can participate in or view a demonstration or an experiment; OR 
d. Part of proceeding is being heard outside a courtroom; OR 
e. Material change in circumstances; OR 
f. Any conditions prescribed by rules made s62A(9) for the purposes of s62A are met

- Cross-examination: Examination of a witness by the adverse party  
- Re-examination: Where a witness has been cross-examined by adverse party and is then examined by the party who called him

Order of EIC, cross-examination and re-examination 
S140(1) of EA
- Witnesses are to be first examined-in-chief => Adverse party cross-examines => Party calling them re-examines 

Examination-in-chief
EIC cannot be on matters outside of AEIC unless it is a new matter after AEIC made 
O 15 r 16(4)
- Witness may not give a EIC on matters not contained in his AEIC 
- Unless it is a new matter which occurred after the date of making of the AEIC

Cross-examination
Cross-examination must relate to relevant facts 
S140(2) of EA
- Examination and Cross-examination must relate to relevant facts

Cross-examination need not be confined to facts testified in EIC
S140(2) of EA

Re-examination 
Re-examination is for explaining matters referred to in cross-examination 
S140(3)
- Re-examination must be directed to the explanation of matter referred to in cross-examination 

Court can permit introduction of new matter in re-examination => Adverse party will have right to cross-examine the new matter
S140(3)
- If Court permits a new matter to be introduced in re-examination => The adverse party may further cross-examine upon the matter 

Miscellaneous Issue: Leading questions in EIC, re-examination and cross-examination 
Definition of leading questions
S143 of Evidence Act
- Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or expects to receive or suggesting disputed facts as to which the witness is to testify 

If leading questions are asked in EIC/Re-examination => Opposing party can object => Witness need not answer unless Court allows for the leading question  
S144(1) of Evidence Act
- Leading questions must not be asked in an EIC or in a re-examination if the adverse party objects except with the permission of the Court 

Court shall allow leading questions (1) Which are introductory or undisputed or (2) Which have been already sufficiently proved
S144(2) of Evidence Act 
Court shall permit leading questions as to matters:
* which are introductory or undisputed or 
* which have in its opinion been already sufficiently proved

Leading questions can be asked in Cross-examination subject to 2 qualifications 
S145(1) of Evidence Act 
- Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination subject to the following qualifications: 
a. Qualification 1: Question must not be put into the mouth of the witness the very words which he is to echo back again; and 
b. Qualification 2: Question must not assume that facts have been proved which have not been proved, or that particular answers have been given contrary to the fact 

Court can exercise discretion to prohibit leading questions 
S145(2) of Evidence Act
- Court in its discretion may prohibit leading questions from being put to a witness who shows a strong interest or bias in favor of the cross-examining party 

Miscellaneous Issue: Preparing witnesses for examination 
Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compania De Navegacion Palomar SA 
- Key principle: Witness’s evidence must be his own independent testimony 
1. Solicitor preparing witness must not allow other persons, including the solicitor, to supplant or supplement the witness’s testimony 
2. Preparation should not be too lengthy or repetitive as over time, oblique comments, non-verbal cues and the general shape of questioning might influence the witness to adopt answers which he did not believe to be the truth (preparation exercise itself carries an inherent danger)
3. Preparation should not be done in groups as that would exacerbate the risk that witnesses might change their testimony to bring it in line with what they believed the best answer to be 

Note:
- Lawyer prepared a script containing certain questions and answers for the witness and it was prepared in a group setting => It casts serious doubt on whether the witness’s evidence is his own 
- If witness made a mistake in practicing his answer => Lawyers would point out discrepancies and lead the witness in answering the question “correctly => Serious doubt as to the witness’s independence 
- However, there is nothing wrong with: 
a. Having practice runs 
b. Lawyer informing witness that his answer contradicts his AEIC and to ask the witness to consider what the true answer is 
c. Lawyer informing the witness of the questions which the opposing counsel might ask regarding the possible inconsistency 

Order of proceedings at trial 
Default Order of Proceedings => Unless Court gives directions 
O 15 r 8(5)
- Court must have control over the order of proceedings and may give the appropriate directions before or during the trial and subject to such directions, the following order of proceedings set out in O 15 r 8(6) to O 15 r 8(13) is to apply

Preliminary: Opening statements and AEIC need not be read out
O 15 r 8(6)
- The opening statements and AEICs need not be read out in Court 

Step 1: Claimant testifies then claimant’s witness testifies 
O 15 r 8(7)

Step 2: Defendant and other parties cross-examine claimant and claimant’s witness
O 15 r 8(8)
- Defendant and any other parties may cross-examine claimant and the claimant’s witnesses 

Step 3: Re-examination of claimant and claimant’s witness 

Step 4: Defendant decide if it wants to submit “No Case to Answer” 
Defendant must show that the evidence in claimant’s case had not made out a case requiring the Defendant to make a Defense 
O 15 r 8(11)
- At conclusion of claimant’s case, defendant may make a submission of “No Case to Answer” in that 
* The evidence in the claimant’s case has not made out a case requiring the defendant to make the defendant’s defense 

Effect of making submission of “No Case to Answer”
O 15 r 8(11)
- Submission of “No Case to Answer” is made on the basis that the following apply in relation to the defendant’s submission: 
a. Defendant will not give any evidence: Defendant will not be giving evidence by himself or through the defendant’s witnesses even if the Court rules against the defendant 
b. Defendant will not pursue counterclaim on same facts: Defendant does not have a counterclaim arising out of substantially the same facts as the claimants case or, if the defendant has such a counterclaim, the defendant withdraws it
c. Where there are multiple defendants: If there is more than one defendant and not all the defendants make the submission of “No case to answer” and the Court decides not to rule immediately on the submission of “No case to answer”, the defendant who makes the submission cannot rely on or make any submissions on the evidence given by any other party and cannot cross?examine any party or witness who gives evidence after the submission was made;
d. Defendant can rely on defendant’s expert evidence if already given: The defendant who makes the submission of “No case to answer” may rely on the evidence of the defendant’s expert and any other expert if those experts have already given evidence as a panel of experts during the claimant’s case;
e. The defendant who makes the submission of “No case to answer” and is unsuccessful may make submissions on the costs of the action.

Step 5: If defendant does not want to make submission of “No Case to Answer” => Defendant testifies then defendant’s witness testifies 
O 15 r 8(9)
- When the claimant and the claimant’s witnesses have completed giving their evidence, subject to paragraph (11), the defendant must begin and testify before the defendant’s witness

Step 6: Claimant and other parties cross-examine defendant and defendant’s witness
O 15 r 8(10)
- Claimant and any other parties may cross-examine defendant and defendant’s witness 

Step 7: Re-examination of defendant and defendant’s witness

Step 8: Court can give decision immediately after hearing or at a later date 
O 15 r 8(13)
- Court may give its decision immediately after the hearing or at a later date 

O 15 r 18(12)
- At the conclusion of evidence for all parties, Court must hear the submissions of all parties in the order that the Court considers appropriate 

Miscellaneous Issue: Where party wants certain portions of submissions/examination/cross-examination/re-examination to be conducted by different counsel in the same case 
Paras 96(2) – 96(3) of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021
- If party wants certain portions of submissions/examination/cross-examination/re-examination of witness to be conducted by different counsel in the same case, oral application should be made to Court no later than commencement of trial or hearing

b. The witnesses to be examined, cross-examined or re-examined by each counsel, or the portions of their evidence for which each counsel will conduct the examination, cross-examination or re-examination.
- If permission is granted, counsel must ensure that each is confined to respective issues and portions of evidence and there is no overlap in issues or examination done 

Miscellaneous Issue: Junior assisting counsel is required to deliver the oral opening statement 
Para 96(5)(a) of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021
- Except where lead counsel is a junior counsel, the junior assisting counsel must deliver the oral opening statement unless the Court otherwise orders 


*Pre-trial interim relief 
INTRO
Source of Court’s power for Interim Reliefs (founded in statute)– in order to preserve the status quo, protect interim rights and ensure the case can be fairly adjudicated at the trial
- S4(10) of Civil Law Act
- S18(2) and Para 5 of First Schedule of SCJA 
- S31 and s32 of SCA
Mareva Injunctions 
- Order to individuals and entities not to dispose or dissipate their assets. The assets are not taken away from the individuals and entities 
Search Order
- Search order to enter into premises and seize articles for the purpose of legal proceedings – helpful in intellectual property disputes
Detention and Preservation of property 
- Order to detain and take into custody property e.g. detention of painting that is the subject matter of dispute 
Taking of Samples 
- Order to take samples for the purposes of conducting experiments or examination 

*A. INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTION 
Application for Interim Injunction will be heard by Registrar
Para 72 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Applications for interim junctions will be heard by a Registrar
Difference between interim injunction and freestanding injunction 
Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah 
- Interim injunction: Injunction made in the meantime and until something is done e.g. the final disposal of the matter
- Interlocutory injunction: Injunction made at the interlocutory stage of the suit, prior to the final disposal of the suit 
- Interim injunction is an interlocutory injunction 
Sulzer Pumps Spain SA v Hyflux Membrane Manufacturing (S) Pte Ltd 
- Freestanding injunction is not an interlocutory injunction
- Freestanding injunction: Where the sole and entire purpose of the originating process is to obtain the injunction
- Freestanding injunctions are the main and substantive relief sought but *interlocutory injunctions are ancillary relief sought separate to another substantive claim 
NB: Interim injunctions may be of two kinds, prohibitory and mandatory. Interim injunctions are prohibitory if they forbid the commission or continuance of an act. They are mandatory if that they compel the defendant to do some positive act to repair an omission or restore the status quo by undoing some act.
*Step 1: When can party apply for interlocutory injunction?

Party can apply for interlocutory injunction regardless whether it was mentioned in main originating process (OC/OA)
O 13 r 1(1)
- Party may apply for an injunction whether or not a claim for such relief was included in the party’s originating process, counterclaim or 3rd party notice 
Party can apply for interlocutory injunction before originating process (OC/OA) is issued 
O 13 r 1(2)
- In an urgent case, the claimant may apply for an injunction before the originating process is issued 
*Need for timely application
- The Court normally requires the Applicant to apply for the interlocutory injunction promptly after becoming aware of the facts in relation to which it seeks protection
- A failure on the part of the Applicant to move with real expeditious would undercut the argument that the application is so urgent that it has to be dealt with by way of a without notice application

*Step 2: Applicant must make ex partes (one-sided, without notice) application for interlocutory injunction   

Applicant may make ex partes application for interlocutory injunction by:
1. OA without notice (if you need to file interlocutory injunction urgently before main OC/OA is filed), or 
2. Summons without notice (if main OA/OC has already been filed), 
Both being supported by affidavit.

O 13 r 1(3)
- Where application is urgent and OC has commenced, a party can apply for an interlocutory injunction with OA without notice or summons without notice, supported by affidavit.
Supporting affidavit with contents in O 13 r 1(3) and Para 73 of SCPD
O 13 r 1(3)
- Application must be supported by an affidavit: 
* Explaining urgency 
* Explaining why defendant should not be informed about the application 
* Explaining merits of the application 
Para 73 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Affidavit in support of OA: Applicant must prepare affidavit in support of the OA must state:
a. Reasons the ex partes application is taken without notice and whether applicant believes there is a risk of dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct 
b. Urgency of application including whether there is any particular event that may trigger the dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct 
c. Factual basis for the application, including the basis of any belief that there will be dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct. Whether there have been any past incidents of the same and whether there is any evidence of dishonesty or bad faith of the opponent 
d. Factual basis for any reasonable defenses that may be relied on by the opponent 
e. Whether applicant is aware of any issues relating to jurisdiction, forum non conveniens or service out of Singapore and if so, whether any related application has been or will be made
f. An undertaking to pay for losses that may be caused to the opponent by granting of the orders and stating what assets are available to meet that undertaking and to whom the assets belong
g. Any other material facts which the Court should be aware of 

Skeletal arguments and Notes on hearing with contents in Para 73 of SCPD
Para 73 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Skeletal arguments: Applicant must prepare and file skeletal arguments on points to be raised 
- Note on hearing: Applicant must prepare a note of the hearing setting out salient points and arguments to be served together with Court documents on any opponent not present 
Procedure when urgent application is made outside of Court’s office hours 
Para 85 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021  
- Office hours: Monday to Fridays (excluding public holidays) from 9am – 12.30pm, 2.30pm – 5pm 
- Applicant must contact Registrar on duty through phone number 
- Applicant must prepare all papers required for the application and if the papers have not been filed in Court, applicant must give an undertaking to Registrar to file the documents in Court by such time as the Registrar may direct and, in any event, no later than the next working day 
- Applicant must ensure all applicable notice requirements prescribed are complied with 
- Registrar will only allow for matter to be heard outside office hours if it is so urgent that it cannot be heard the next working day 
- Hearing may take place in Registrar’s chambers in Supreme Court or at any place directed by the Judge or Registrar 
- Registrar may direct counsel to send application and supporting documents by email and he has discretion to deal with application by email or to hear oral arguments from counsel 

*Step 3: Applicant must serve Notice of ex partes application to other concerned parties prior to the hearing unless the Exception applies
Para 71 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Even if party makes an ex partes application interlocutory injunction, party must still give notice of the ex partes application to the other concerned parties prior to the hearing 
Form of notice 
a. Notice may be given by way of letter or email or in cases of extreme urgency, orally by telephone 
b. Notice must inform the other parties of the date, time and place fixed for the hearing and the nature of the relief sought 
c. A copy of the originating process, summons without notice or OA without notice and supporting affidavits should be given to other party in draft form 

Notice must be given a minimum of 2 hours before hearing – Except in cases of extreme urgency
- Except in cases of extreme urgency or with Court’s permission, notice must be given a minimum of 2 hours’ before the hearing 

If any concerned parties are not present at hearing – Applicant must inform Court of certain matters
- At the hearing, if some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, applicant’s lawyers should inform Court of:
a. Attempts made to notify the other parties or their solicitors of the making of the application 
b. Documents given to the other parties or their solicitors and when they were given 
c. Whether the other parties or their solicitors consent to the application being heard without their presence

*EXCEPTION to notice of application (para 71(3) PD): If giving notice would defeat purpose of ex partes application 
- Directions set out here need not be followed if giving of notice to the other parties would or might defeat the purpose of the application without notice:
a. E.g. if defendant would act swiftly to render the injunction application moot
b. Reasons for not following directions should be clearly set out and substantiated in the affidavit supporting the summons / OA without notice 

*Step 4: Applicant must satisfy duty to disclose all material facts in ex partes application 
Applicant duty to disclose to the Court: (1) All material facts that applicant knows or reasonably ought to know, and (2) Any matter that may adversely affect merits of applicant’s injunction --> DUTY OF FULL AND FRANK DISCLOSURE
O 13 r 1(5)
- Party applying for injunction has a duty to disclose to the Court: 
* All material facts that the party knows or reasonably ought to know
* Including any matter that may affect the merits of the party’s case adversely 

Material facts: Facts which enable the Court to make an informed decision 
Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltd v Tan Beng Huwah 
- Material facts: Facts which enable the Court to make an informed decision 
a. Matters which Court should consider in making its decision 
b. Defenses which might be reasonably raised by the defendant 
c. If there were unsuccessful prior proceedings and the reasons for dismissal then 
d. Material facts are limits to what the applicant could reasonably be expected to know or to have found out through proper inquiries at the point of application 

*Consequences for breach of duty: Setting aside of injunction 
- Breach of duty to disclose to provide full and frank disclosure is an independent ground for setting aside an injunction 

Reason for Duty to disclose
The “Vasiliy Golovin”
- Duty of disclosure in ex partes application: Applicant must disclose to the court all matters within his knowledge which might be material even if they are prejudicial to the applicant’s claim 
- Manner of disclosure: not open for Applicant to say that it has fulfilled the duty simply because the relevant facts can be distilled from the voluminous documents exhibited to the affidavit. Material facts should be fairly stated in the text of the affidavit itself
- Reason
a. Injunctions can cause irreparable damage to parties concerned
b. In an ex partes application, Court does not have the benefit of countervailing arguments (from the opposing party) and may not be appropriately sensitized to the real merits of the application and the potentially hazardous ramifications 
c. Applicant has a duty to ensure that the Court is given a balanced view of the matter

*Step 5: Applicant must satisfy 2-stage test for Court to grant interlocutory injunction 
American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd 
- 2-stage test:
1. Whether there is a serious question to be tried, and
2. the “balance of convenience” being is in favor of granting the injunction sought 

Stage 1: Whether there is a serious question to be tried
- Applicant needs to show that he has a cause of action that is not frivolous or vexatious, with prospects of success which in substance and reality exist
- The prospect of success is only to be investigated to a limited extent and the threshold is low – the Court is not required to evaluate the chances of success in the action on a balance of probabilities

Stage 2: Whether the balance of convenience is in favor of granting the injunction sought
- Court needs to assess the extent to which each party is capable of being compensated in damages in the event that the opposing party wins at trial 
a. If applicant (for injunction) can be compensated by damages + defendant is in position to pay such damages => Injunction against defendant unlikely granted 
b. If applicant (for injunction) cannot be adequately compensated by damages + if applicant has provided an undertaking to compensate any of defendant’s damages => Injunction against defendant likely granted
- Court should take the course which appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if that course should ultimately turn out to have been the wrong one at trial, in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish its rights at trial (i.e. helping out losing party), or failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at trial (i.e. not helping out successful party)

*Application to interim mandatory injunctions vs prohibitory injunctions
Chuan Hong Petrol Station v Shell Singapore
GENERAL RULE: the court will grant an interim injunction to preserve the status quo pending trial, and “should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong at trial in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish his rights at the trial, or of failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at the trial”. 
--> i.e. the court will try to grant relief to a losing party or fail to help an eventually successful party

EXCEPTION 1: However, this general rule does NOT apply where an interim mandatory injunction is sought (compelling the defendant to do a positive act).
- Such an injunction is “a very exceptional discretionary remedy” and there is thus “a much higher threshold to be met in order to persuade the court to grant such an injunction as compared to a prohibitive injunction” (NCC International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd)
- Such an injunction should only be granted if there are “special circumstances” (NCC International at [75]), in a “clear case” or if there is a “high degree of assurance” that it will appear at trial to have been rightly granted, and this is a higher standard than is required for a prohibitory injunction (Chuan Hong at [85]-[86])
- This is because “a high degree of assurance” is a guideline which reflects the fundamental principle of lower risk of injustice (Chuan Hong Petrol Station; followed in Projector SA v Marubeni International Petroleum (S) Pte Ltd [2005] 2 SLR(R) 144)

--> Need for caution arises from the recognition that an interim mandatory injunction is a more invasive remedy and, as such, may lead to irreversible prejudice to a defendant. A court must therefore be sure, in accordance with the fundamental principle described above, that the grant of the interim mandatory injunction is indeed the course of action which carries the lower risk of injustice – in other words, that the prejudice to the applicant from not granting the interim mandatory injunction outweighs that to the defendant from granting it. This will not be an easy hurdle to surmount

EXCEPTION 2: The general rule also does NOT apply to interim prohibitory injunctions where a defendant is about to breach, or has already breached, a negative covenant in a contract, and the interim prohibitory injunction sought is to restrain a prospective breach or a further breach. --> I.E. LOWER STANDARD COMPARED TO NORMAL PROHIBITORY INJUNCTIONS SINCE D SHOULD NORMALLY OBSERVE THE CONTRACT IT ENTERED INTO
- An interim prohibitory injunction WILL readily be granted to restrain a prospective breach or a further breach
- The court in such a case is NOT concerned whether there is a serious question to be tried and whether the balance of convenience is in favour of granting such an interim injunction. That damages would be an adequate remedy is not generally a relevant consideration
- As the remedy is an equitable one, it is in principle discretionary, and it may be refused on the ground that it would cause particular hardship as to be oppressive to the defendant. But the burden caused by having to observe the contract does NOT qualify as hardship
- An injunction will only be refused if a defendant shows hardship over and above that which results from having to observe the contract

Reasoning:
- Gee: There is a strong policy for enforcing bargains and this goes to the extent of enforcing a negative covenant. There is a strong presumption that the covenant will be enforced by injunction, albeit the matter remains discretionary.
- Bean, Parry and Burns: Any argument that granting an injunction to uphold a contractual bargain would cause hardship should be “treated with some scepticism, since the defendant has undertaken the obligation voluntarily”. 


*Step 6: Court might require Applicant to provide an undertaking to compensate any of defendant’s damages if interlocutory injunction is granted 
- Whether applicant’s undertaking can compensate defendant’s damages is a factor under Stage 2 of American Cyanamid too
Court can request applicant provide undertaking before granting injunction 
2022 White Book at [13/1/28]
- Forms 24 and 25 enables applicant to provide an undertaking => Court can decide whether to enforce an undertaking if the defendant incurs losses as a result of the interlocutory injunction

Undertaking as a condition of interlocutory injunction
2022 White Book at [13/1/29]
- Undertaking ought to be a condition of every interlocutory injunction 

Extent of undertaking – Undertaking usually given to all defendants in the case including defendants against whom no injunction is made => However, not defendants who have joined after interlocutory injunction has been discharged
2022 White Book at [13/1/30]
- Undertaking in damages given by the claimant extends to all defendants in the case including defendant against whom no injunction is made and defendants jointed after it is granted
- However, a defendant who joined after an interlocutory injunction granted against another defendant has been discharged is not entitled to the benefit of the undertaking 
=> Reason: It is pointless at time of grant of injunction to predict which defendants will be affected if injunction turns out to have been granted improperly since damages will be payable only where damage is actually suffered 

Court can request that applicant fortify the undertaking by giving security 
2022 White Book at [13/1/33]
- Court may impose a condition that the claimant’s undertaking should be fortified by his giving security:
* By the bond of an insurance company or 
* By payment into court or 
* By some other means e.g. payment to the applicant’s solicitors or to the solicitors for each party jointly to be held pending further order 
- Defendant can apply for Injunction applicant to fortify his undertaking if he can show that: 
a. The Court has made an intelligent estimate of the likely amount of loss which might result to the defendant by reason of the injunction 
b. There is a sufficient level of risk of loss and the undertaking will be insufficient 
c. The contemplated loss would be caused by the grant of the injunction 
- Defendant should apply for security at the time when injunction is granted, after an inter partes hearing and the undertaking is given 

If defendant wins at trial => Defendant can apply to enforce C’s undertaking => Court will consider 2 questions
2022 White Book at [13/1/34] – [13/1/37]
- Undertaking is given to the Court => If it is held at trial that the interlocutory injunction ought not to have been granted in the first instance => Defendant can apply to Court for the undertaking to be enforced 
- Court will ask two things: 
1. Should the Court order that the undertaking be enforced?
2. Has defendant suffered any damage by reason of the granting of the interlocutory injunction? 

Question 1: Should the Court order that the undertaking be enforced?
- Court should exercise discretion in accordance with equitable principles and consider: 
a. Whether interlocutory injunction order was wrongly asked for by the applicant 
(i) For Mareva injunction: Depends on whether risk of dissipation existed at time of grant of injunction and its continuance 
(ii) For ordinary interlocutory injunction: Depends on whether a final injunction is granted at trial 
b. Whether special circumstances existed in the case

Question 2: Has defendant suffered any damage by reason of the granting of the interlocutory injunction? 
- Court will have to decide causation and quantum of damages 
- Measure of damages: Loss which is the natural consequence of the interlocutory injunction 


*B. MAREVA INJUNCTION 
- Injunction or freezing order to prohibit the disposal of assets by a defendant to defeat a potential judgement. It cover assets locally in Singapore or worldwide where assets are wholly or partly located abroad

Application for Mareva Injunction will be heard by Judge
Para 72 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Applications for Mareva injunctions will be heard by a Judge 
- Applicant should not inform any 3rd party of proceedings until after the return date 

Can Mareva injunction be granted to in aid of foreign proceedings where there are no substantive proceedings in Singapore? 
Bi Xiaoqiong v China Medical Technologies
- No. 
- A *Mareva Injunction is merely an ancillary relief that cannot be “free-standing” and this means that it must be grounded on a reasonable accrued cause of action in Singapore before it is granted. 

Difference between Mareva injunction and proprietary injunction 
Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compania De Navegacion Palomar SA
- Proprietary injunction: Injunction which fastens on a specific asset in which the applicant asserts a proprietary interest. The defendant is prevented from dealing with the specific asset and any of its traceable proceeds
- Mareva injunction: Injunction granted in support of a substantive claim for personal relief and it does not latch onto any specific asset of the defendant. The defendant is prevented from disposing of his own assets (from a pool) beyond a certain value such that he would be able to defeat a possible judgement that may be rendered against him --> therefore no objection in principle to a defendant being allowed to use assets subject to a Mareva injunction for living expenses, as long as it does not conflict with the policy underlying the Mareva jurisdiction

Step 1: When can party apply for Mareva injunction? (same as interlocutory application above)

*Step 2: Applicant must make ex partes application for Mareva injunction
Applicant may make ex partes application for Mareva injunction by OA or summons, supported by affidavit, with/without notice
O 13 r 1(3)
- Same as interlocutory injunctions generally: made by OA or summons, supported by affidavit, with or without notice (in cases of urgency)
- Such applications which are draconian, will be heard by a Judge and not a registrar (Para 72(1) SCPD 2021)

Local Mareva injunction – Ex partes application must be in Form 24
O 13 r 1(6): Local Mareva injunction 
- A local injunction prohibiting the disposal of assets in Singapore must be in Form 24

International Mareva injunction – Ex partes application must be in Form 25
O 13 r 1(7): International Mareva injunction 
- A worldwide injunction prohibiting the disposal of assets worldwide must be in Form 25

If Applicant departs from Forms used => Applicant must justify departure in the supporting affidavit 
Para 72 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Forms 24 and 25 of Appendix A of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 should be used
- If applicant departs from the forms used, must justify in his supporting affidavit 

Step 3: Applicant must serve Notice of ex partes application to other concerned parties prior to the hearing unless Exception (same as interlocutory application above)

Step 4: Applicant must satisfy duty to disclose all material facts in ex partes application (same as interlocutory application above)

*Step 5: Applicant must satisfy 4 limbs + Convince Court that it is just and equitable for Court to grant domestic Mareva injunction 
2022 White Book at [13/1/60]
- For a domestic Mareva injunction, the claimant must show 
1. There is a valid cause of action [referring to the main action] over which the Court has jurisdiction; AND
2. There is a good arguable case on the merits of the claimant’s claim; AND
3. The defendant has assets within the jurisdiction; AND
4. There is a real risk that the defendants will dissipate his assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated judgement of the Court 
- Court will then consider whether it would be just and convenient to grant a Mareva injunction 

Limb 1: There is a valid cause of action over which the Court has jurisdiction
2022 White Book at [13/1/61] 
- Claimant must show that he has a substantive claim over which Singapore Court has jurisdiction 
- Reason: A Mareva injunction is an ancillary remedy collateral to the main action and cannot stand on its own 

Limb 2: There is a good arguable case on the merits of the claimant’s claim
2022 White Book at [13/1/63] 
- A good arguable case is one which is more than barely capable of serious agreement but not necessarily one which the judge considers would have a better than a 50% chance of success 

Limb 3: The defendant has assets within the jurisdiction
2022 White Book at [13/1/64] – [13/1/65] 
- Applicant for Mareva injunction must give grounds for believing that the defendant has assets within the jurisdiction and identify what assets are available 
Applicant can use Ancillary Order (an “ancillary asset disclosure order”) to require Defendant to disclose all his assets in an affidavit to the Applicant
Ancillary Order requiring defendant to disclose all his assets in his affidavit to the applicant (Sea Trucks Offshore Ltd v Roomans Jacobus Johannes) 
- Note – this order is usually applied for in the main application for Mareva injunction – no point making a separate application. 
- Assets which must be disclosed:
a. Assets legally owned by defendant 
b. Assets beneficially held by defendant 
- Assets which need not be disclosed: 
a. Assets legally owned by defendant but held on trust for 3rd parties 
b. Assets of a company entirely owned by defendant
==> However: Defendant’s shareholding in the company are still caught by the injunction and defendant would still be restricted from procuring the company to make disposals other than in the ordinary course of business because that could lead to diminution of his share value
- Disclosure obligations would not go further than what is required for Applicant to enforce Mareva injunction  

Special Scenario: Where Defendant disputes ownership of an asset (e.g. 3P ownership)
1. If the assets appear to belong to a 3rd party then they should NOT be included in the scope of the Mareva injunction without evidence that they are the defendant’s 
2. The mere assertion of the defendant that a 3rd party owns the assets need not be accepted without inquiry and the same principle applies to claims by a 3rd party to intervene to vary the injunction to exclude the assets 
3. Court must do its best to do what is just and convenient between all concerned
4. In a proper case, the Court may direct an issue to be tried either before or after the main action as to the ownership of the assets 

Limb 4: There is a real risk that the defendants will dissipate his assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated judgement of the Court 
2022 White Book at [13/1/66] 
- Applicant must show solid evidence that there is a risk that assets will be dissipated 
- Examples of such evidence:
a. Direct evidence that the defendant has previously acted in a way which shows that his probity is not to be relied on 
b. If the defendant is a company, its incorporation, corporate structure and assets so as to raise an inference that the defendant is not to be relied on 
c. The fact that inquiries about the characteristics of the defendant have led to nothing 
- Court can consider the nature of assets sought to be injuncted and the ease with which such assets can be dissipated 
The true ground for a Mareva injunction is the real risk of dissipation of assets by the party sought to be restrained (Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar v Accent Delight International Ltd [2015] 5 SLR 558). This involves whether there was sufficient evidence that the subject of the injunction would, or at least were likely to, dissipate their assets so as to defeat or frustrate the realisation of a judgment that the applicants might eventually obtain against them (Heng Holdings SEA (Pte) Ltd v Tomongo Shipping Co. Ltd [1997] 2 SLR(R) 669). 

Allegation of dishonesty alone is insufficient => Need to establish a real risk of dissipation
Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar v Accent Delight International Ltd 
- An allegation of dishonesty does not by itself obviate the need to establish a real risk of dissipation => The allegation of dishonesty has to be of a nature or characteristic that sufficiently bears upon the risk of dissipation 

Effect of Mareva injunction on defendant’s bank account 
2022 White Book at [13/1/64]
- If defendant’s assets consist of a bank account which contains a mixture of defendant’s money and 3rd party’s money => Court has jurisdiction to restrain defendant from removing or dealing with any of the money in the account 
- If defendant’s money is under control of a 3rd party bank account, the 3rd party bank and the defendant will both be enjoined and restrained from removing or dealing with the money in the bank account 

*C. COSTS ORDER FOR INJUNCTIONS 
Costs of injunction depends on discretion of judge 
Chiarapurk Jack v Haw Par Bros International Pte Ltd 
- Question of costs depends on discretion of the judge hearing the application and the judge can order costs to be in the cause 
Common order – Costs to be in the cause
- Losing party will be made to pay costs to winning party 

*D. SEARCH ORDER – ANTON PILLER ORDER 
Applicable where there is a grave danger that the defendant would dispose of or destroy incriminating evidence in its possession. This complements the Court’s powers to grant an order for the detention and preservation of property and taking of samples (see below).
- The order allows the claimant or its representative to enter the defendant’s premises to enter and search for, inspect and seize material so they may be preserved until the trial
- Such orders involves a serious interference with the defendant’s privacy and can seriously disrupt operations in the case of business premises
- Due to the draconian nature of such orders, they are remedies granted only when it is essential or necessary in the interests of justice and the requirements are stringent – Court will generally insist upon a clear showing of fraud, dishonesty or imminent removal or destruction of property/evidence

Step 1: When can party apply for search order? (same as interlocutory application above)

*Step 2: Applicant must make ex partes application for search order (same as interlocutory application above)
Applicant may make ex partes application for search order by OA without notice or summons without notice, supported by affidavit
O 13 r 1(3)
- Party’s application for interlocutory injunction may be by OA without notice or summons without notice, supported by affidavit stating urgency, etc. (refer above)

Search order – Ex partes application must be in Form 26
O 13 r 1(8)
- A search order must be in Form 26 of Appendix A of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021
- If applicant departs from the form used, must justify in his supporting affidavit (Para 72(2) of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021)

Step 3: Applicant must satisfy duty to disclose all material facts in ex partes application (same as interlocutory application above)

*Step 4: Applicant must satisfy 4 limbs + Convince Court that the search order is proportionate for Court to grant search order  
2022 White Book at [13/1/87]
Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)
- 4 limbs for making of a search order 
1. Limb 1: Applicant must have strong prima facie main case: There must be an extremely strong prima facie case of a civil cause of action. 
a. A scrutiny of the merits of the claimant’s main case is an essential preliminary to the grant of a search order 
2. Limb 2: Damage to be avoided by applicant must be very serious: Damage, potential or actual, to the claimant to be avoided by the grant of a search order must be very serious 
a. If search order is sought to forestall the destruction of evidence, the evidence in question must be of major and critical importance 
3. Limb 3: Clear evidence that defendant has incriminating evidence: There must be clear evidence that the defendant has in his possession incriminating documents or items 
4. Limb 4: Real possibility that defendant will destroy evidence: There must be a real possibility that the defendant may destroy such material before an application inter partes can be made 

Proportionality – The harm likely to be caused by the execution of the search order to the defendant and his business affairs must not be excessive or out of proportion to the legitimate object of the search order 
Bengawan Solo Pte Ltd v Season Confectionary Pte Ltd
- Principle of proportionality is particularly relevant where the search order results in the seizure of trading stock or the perusal by the claimant of the defendant’s confidential commercial documents 
- Held: 
1. Court discharged the search order and commented that if any search order is really required, a limited search order for the claimants to enter a couple of outlets to take a few samples of the infringing mooncakes for preservation should have been considered  
Computerland Corp v Yew Seng Computers Pte Ltd 
- Search order has a draconian nature and it should only be granted in exceptional circumstances
- Court has to balance the claimant’s right to recover his property or to preserve evidence against the violation of the privacy of a defendant who has no opportunity to put his side of the case 

*Step 5: Court might require Applicant to provide an undertaking to compensate any of defendant’s damages if search order is granted 
Court can require applicant/applicant’s solicitor to provide undertaking
2022 White Book at [13/1/90] 
- Applicant, the applicant’s solicitors and the supervising solicitor might be required to give an undertaking 
- Undertaking can be: 
* Payment into Court 
* By provision of a bond by an insurance company which has a place of business within Singapore
* By a written guarantee from a bank which as a place of business within Singapore 
* Payment to the applicant’s solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an officer of the court pending further order  
Undertaking: Applicant give undertaking to compensate Defendant for any loss caused by the search order/execution of search order
- The undertaking is that the applicant should comply with any order the Court may make if the Court later finds that the search order or carrying out of the search order has caused loss to the defendant and decides that the defendant should be compensated for that loss 
- Court must be satisfied that the applicant is good for sums which may be due upon his undertaking as to damages 

*Step 6: Procedure for carrying out search under Search Order
Search must be carried out in supervising solicitor’s presence and under his supervision
Para 72(5) of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Form 26 must be served by a supervising solicitor and affidavit should include the identity and experienced of proposed supervising solicitor
- Search must be carried out in supervising solicitor’s presence and under his supervision 
- Supervising solicitor: An experienced solicitor who is not a member or employee of the firm acting for the applicant and who has some familiarity with the operation of search orders 

*E. ORDER FOR DETENTION AND PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY AND THE TAKING OF SAMPLES 
Order for Detention and Preservation of property
- Used for the interim preservation of property and evidence
- Procedure: summons supported by affidavit
- Need not be made on application of any party – such orders can be made by the Court on its own accord

Order must be against a property which is the subject matter of action/gives rise to issues in the action
O 13 r 2(1)
- Court may order the detention, custody or preservation of any property which is the subject matter of or may give rise to issues in an action 
==> Property must be the subject matter of the issues in an action e.g. a machine which is alleged to constitute an infringement of a patent 

Ancillary Order: Allow applicant to inspect opposing party’s property
O 13 r 2(2)
- Court may order the inspection of any such property in the possession or control of a party

Ancillary Order: Authorize applicant to enter place to detain and preserve property 
O 13 r 2(3)
- Court may authorize any person to enter upon any immovable property in the possession or control of any party to effect any order made under O 13 r 2(1) and 2(2)

Special Scenario: If the property is a right to a specific fund 
O 13 r 2(4)
- Where there is a dispute as to the right of any party to a specific fund, Court may order the fund to be paid into Court or otherwise secured 

Order for Taking of Samples of property
Order must be against a property which is the subject matter of action/gives rise to issues in action 
O 13 r 3(1)
- If any property is the subject matter of or may give rise to issues in an action, the Court may order 
a. Any sample of the property to be taken; and 
b. Any experiment or examination to be conducted on the sample 
==> Property must be the subject matter of the issues in an action 

Ancillary Order: Authorize applicant to enter place to take samples 
O 13 r 3(2)
- Court may authorize any person to enter upon any immovable property in the possession or control of any party to effect any order made under O 13 r 3(1)

UCMI Ltd v Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd 
- Applicant needs to demonstrate a danger of destruction to existing evidence
- Issue relates to the authenticity of a document signed by Mr Lim
- Applicant sought an order to compel Mr Lim to: 
a. Make and provide handwriting samples
b. Provide similar documents previously made in the course of business which had a sample of Mr Lim’s handwriting 
- Held: Court rejected both orders 
1. Order (a) rejected because an order “compelling Mr Lim to replicate his handwriting” is not an order for taking of samples. The handwriting samples were not even in existence and could not fall under the definition of property  
2. Order (b) rejected because there was no evidence to suggest that the documents were in danger of being destroyed 

Order for Taking of Samples not applicable to choses in action (e.g. bank money in bank account)
Sang Cheol Woo v Charles Choi Spackman 
- Orders only apply to property and does not apply to choses in action => Implication is that orders cannot be over money in a bank account which is a chose in action i.e. right to money in a bank account => Applicant who wants an order to apply to money in a bank account has to try and use O 13 r 2(4) (under an order for detention and preservation, rather than taking of samples)


Post-judgment recourse 
*A. FURTHER ARGUMENTS (TO THE SAME COURT)
1. State Courts
2. GDHC
3. ADHC/CA 
4. Reliance on further evidence in further arguments 

*Further Arguments in State Courts 
Procedure for party to request to make Further Arguments in State Courts
Para 81 of State Courts Practice Directions 2021 
(1) Party must file Request for Further Arguments through Electronic Filing Service: All requests for further arguments shall be made by way of a “Request for Further Arguments” and filed through the Electronic Filing Service.
(2) Contents of Request: The party filing the Request must, either in the Request or a document attached thereto:
a. state the party making the request;
b. identify the Judge or Registrar who heard the matter in question;
c. specify when the order concerned was made;
d. state the provision of law under which the request is made;
e. set out the proposed further arguments briefly, together with any supporting authorities; and
f. include a copy of each of the authorities cited.
(3) Party must furnish a copy of Request to all concerned parties: A copy of the Request must be furnished to all parties concerned.
(4) Request must be addressed to Registrar: All Requests must be addressed to the Registrar.

*Further Arguments in GDHC (only for decisions made during trial e.g. interlocutory applications, but not for hearing of a full trial)
Further Arguments only for decisions during trial (e.g. interlocutory application), but not after trial
S29B(1) of Supreme Court Judicature Act 
- Further Arguments are not allowed after hearing of a full trial: S29B statutory framework applies to a decision by a judge in the original or appellate civil jurisdiction after any hearing other than a trial of an action 
o No further arguments after a trial
o But further arguments can be made after a decision is made in an application
- Further Arguments may be allowed in any other type of hearing

TG Master v Tung Kee Development
- The High Court does NOT have the jurisdiction to hear further arguments after a trial
- Parliament intended to curtail the HC’s inherent jurisdiction to hear further arguments after a trial, by excluding the hearing of further arguments after a trial from its conferral of statutory jurisdiction to hear further arguments in other matters
- The possibility of further arguments being heard was only ever intended to apply for interlocutory applications and not a full trial. The underlying concerns behind the need to retain the right to request for further arguments were borne out of: 
(a) the short amount of preparation time that counsels have to present their arguments to a judge in chambers for interlocutory applications, and 
(b) the correspondingly short amount of deliberation time a judge has before making an interlocutory order quickly, and sometimes, even on the spot for urgent applications

Time to Request for Further Arguments in GDHC – 
before any notice of appeal is filed AND before earlier of:
(1) time at which judgement is extracted OR 
(2) 15th day after date of judgement 
S29B(2) SCJA
- GDHC Judge who made the decision may hear further arguments in respect of the decision if parties/GDHC Judge requests for further arguments: 
* Before any notice of appeal is filed against the decision; AND 
* Before the earlier of the following: 
a. Time at which judgement or order relating to the decision is extracted; OR 
b. 15th day after the date on which the decision is made 

GDHC Judge powers after hearing Further Arguments – may affirm, vary or set aside decision
S29B(3) SCJA
- After hearing further arguments, the Judge may affirm, vary or set aside the decision

Effect of Request for Further Arguments on Appeals --> I.E. RFFA BLOCKS ANY NOTICES OF APPEAL FROM BEING FILED
S29B(4) SCJA
- If a request for further arguments has been made under subsection s29B(2): 
a. Notice of Appeal cannot be filed against the decision until:
(i) Judge affirms, varies or set asides decision after hearing further arguments; or
(ii) Judge certifies no Further Arguments are required; and

b. The time for filing a notice of appeal in respect of the decision begins on the date the Judge: 
a. Affirms, varies or sets aside the decision after hearing further arguments; or
b. Certifies, or is deemed to have certified, that no further arguments are required

Procedure for party to request to make Further Arguments in GDHC
O 18 r 28 of ROC 
(1) Party must make request by letter to Registrar of Supreme Court => Must serve letter on all parties: A request to the Judge sitting in the General Division for further arguments from the parties after he or she has given his or her decision on an application in the exercise of original or appellate jurisdiction, must be made by letter to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and served on all parties to the application.
(2) Time of Request: s29B(2) of SCJA: The request in paragraph (1) must be made within the time provided in section 29B(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. --> i.e. before notice of appeal is filed + before judgement is extracted or 15 days after date of decision (whichever earlier)

- Unless the appellate Court otherwise directs, there are to be no further arguments from the parties after:
* The appellate Court has heard the appeal and reserved its decision or 
* After the appellate Court has given its decision in the appeal

No Further Arguments in ADHC/CA after:

ARW v Comptroller of Income Tax 
- Further evidence in support of new arguments made (not raised previously) in the course of Further Arguments may be allowed
- Further evidence to strengthen or support previously raised arguments are not allowed 
 
*B. APPEALS (TO A HIGHER LEVEL COURT)
Basics 
Step 1: Is there a right to appeal? 
Step 2: If so, is permission to appeal required? And from which Court should permission be obtained?
Step 3: Is it an Order 18 or Order 19 case? 
Step 4: Which Order 18 case/Order 19 case? 
Step 5: General provisions which apply to both Order 18 case and Order 19 case
a. Timeline for appealing and applying for permission to appeal 
b. Appeal is not a stay of enforcement (no automatic stay of enforcement while appeal is pending)
c. Expedited appeal 
Step 6: Respective flow will apply 

FOCUS of the course is on:
(a) Allocation of appeals from GDHC to ADHC and CA
(b) Requirement for permission for leave to appeal against a decision of the GDHC

Structure of Order 18 (streamlined process): 
Division 1
General (all tiers)Division 2
r 15 – 16 
Appeal within State Courts: Registrar to District Judge

Division 3
r 17 – 23 
Appeals from District Judge/Magistrate to GDHC 
Division 4 
r 24 – 25 
Appeal within Supreme Court: Registrar to GDHC
 Division 5 
r 26 – 41
Appeal within Supreme Court: GDHC to ADHC/CA
Types of appeals:
* Appeals from applications in an action (and further appeals from there)
* Appeals from other decisions of the Registrar (including on assessment, accounts and OAs)
* Appeals from DJ/Mag decision on OAs
* Appeals from summonses within O 18 appeals or O 19 appeals

Appeals under Order 18 are for more straightforward issues, like appeals on applications filed in an action, e.g. interlocutory matters, document production, striking out, etc.. Not much documentation has to be filled, so timelines are also shorter.

Structure of Order 19 (more detailed documentation): 
Division 1
General (all tiers of appeal under O 19)Division 2
r 13 – 23 
Appeals from DJ/Mag in State Courts to GDHC Division 3
r 24 – 40 
Appeals from GDHC to ADHC/CA 

Further Appeals from ADHC to CA
Division 4 
r 41 
Appeals from Disciplinary Tribunal to 3 Judges of the GDHC (under Medical Registration Act)Types of appeals:
* Appeals from judgements of DJ/Mag in OCs, assessments, accounts, committal
* Appeals from judgements of the GDHC (excluding Registrar)
* Appeals from judgements of the ADHC
* Appeals from tribunals to the ADHC or CA pursuant to written law
* Appeals from a Medical Registration Act Disciplinary Tribunal to 3 Judges of GDHC

Appeals under Order 19 are for more complex matters after a more protracted process, the documentation required is more extensive and timeline for appeals are also longer.

Appeals – general issues
Filing of an appeal does not operate as a stay of enforcement of the lower Court’s order / judgement, unless the lower or appellate Court orders otherwise
Default position: lower Court’s position or judgement continues to have full effect unless the lower or appellate Court orders otherwise. That means you can enforce the lower Court’s judgement while the appeal is pending unless you can depart from this position.

Order 18: General rule that an appeal does not operate as a stay of enforcement 
O 18 r 6 of ROC
(1) Except so far as the lower Court or the appellate Court may otherwise direct, an appeal does not operate as a stay of enforcement or of proceedings under the decision of the lower Court.
(2) Except so far as the appellate Court may otherwise direct, no intermediate act or proceeding is to be invalidated by an appeal.
(3) On an appeal, interest for such time as enforcement has been delayed by the appeal is to be allowed unless the lower Court or the appellate Court otherwise orders.

Order 19: General rule that an appeal does not operate as a stay of enforcement 
O 19 r 6 of ROC
(1) Except so far as the lower Court or the appellate Court may otherwise direct, an appeal does not operate as a stay of enforcement or of proceedings under the decision of the lower Court
(2) Except so far as the appellate Court may otherwise direct, no intermediate act or proceeding is to be invalidated by an appeal
(3) On an appeal, interest for such time as enforcement has been delayed by the appeal is to be allowed unless the lower Court or the appellate Court otherwise orders.

Some notes on this 
- If enforcement is not stayed before appeal, and the appeal is successful, then the successful appellant is entitled to return of sums paid under the original judgment. Court order can be granted to compel this (I think this is not in syllabus). 
- Practically, this means that if you think the opposing party is not likely to abide by an appeal decision, then you should apply for stay of enforcement pending appeal 

Expedited appeal
Expedited appeal if urgent or special reason 
O 18 r 11(1) of ROC
- If the appeal is urgent or there is a special reason, the lower Court or the appellate Court may order an expedited appeal upon any party’s application or on its own accord.

O 19 r 9(1) of ROC
- If the appeal is urgent or there is a special reason, the lower Court or the appellate Court may order an expedited appeal upon any party’s application or on its own accord.

Dispense with compliance of any provisions for Expedited appeal 
O 18 r 11(2) of RPC
- In an expedited appeal, the lower Court or the appellate Court may dispense with compliance with any provision of these Rules or practice directions or modify them for the purposes of the appeal.

O 19 r 9(2) of RPC
- In an expedited appeal, the lower Court or the appellate Court may dispense with compliance with any provision of these Rules or practice directions or modify them for the purposes of the appeal.

Flow for all types of Appeals

Reason for appeals identified under Sixth Schedule to be heard by CA instead of ADHC
Noor Azlin binte Abdul Rahman & Anor v Changi General Hospital [2021] SGCA 5
- Split into ADHC and CA is designed to enable ADHC to share in CA’s caseload by hearing civil appeals against GDHC divisions 
- Reasons for appeals identified under Sixth Schedule to be heard by CA: 
a. The appeals are likely to have substantial consequences for individuals or society
b. The appeals may involve questions of law of public interest which would benefit from guidance of the apex court in Singapore 
c. The appeals concern the general administration of justice 
d. The appeals involve novel questions of law or new areas of law which would benefit from guidance from CA 
e. The appeals may involve issues that are likely to be important and require earlier clarification from the CA
f. The appeals relate to strategic areas that would benefit from the stature of the apex court, such as the areas of laws which seek to bolster Singapore’s status as a dispute resolution hub or debt restructuring hub 
On when a case is “a case relating to” a specified subject matter in paragraphs 1(a)-(e) of Sixth Schedule SCJA
Seow Fook Sen Aloysius v Rajah & Tann Singapore
- The appeals which the Sixth Schedule provides are to be made to the Court of Appeal by default can be classified into three categories:
(a) First, where the appeal “arises from a case relating to” specified subject matter, such as constitutional or administrative law, contempt of court, the law of arbitration, insolvency or the law of patents. This is provided for in paras 1(a)-(e) of the Sixth Schedule. Importantly, as the words in parentheses in paras 1(a)-(e) make clear, even if the appeal itself does not raise issues relating to specified subject matter, so long as it “arises from a case relating to” that subject matter, it will nevertheless come within the Sixth Schedule.
(b) Second, where the appeal is against particular decisions of the General Division, such as a decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) (see para 1(f)), a decision made under the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 (see para 1(g)), a judgment or order made in an action brought under s 47(8) of the Presidential Elections Act 1991 (see para 1(h)), or a decision made under the Mediation Act 2017 or the Singapore Convention on Mediation Act 2020 (see paras 1(k) and (l)).
(c) Third, where the appeal is to be made to the Court of Appeal under written laws (see paras 1(i) and (j)).

- What is clear is that Parliament could NOT have intended for the criteria in paras 1(a)-(e) to be satisfied so long as the specified subject matter features somewhat by way of factual background to the “case”, even if this is by way of the most tenuous or tangential manner (it follows, of course, that the said criteria would clearly not be satisfied if the specified subject matter does not even feature in the factual background to the “case” itself). In our view, there must be something more. Otherwise, the criteria in paras 1(a)-(e) would have an exceedingly low threshold that can be satisfied in almost every instance, and which may, as a result, no longer operate to draw a distinction between those appeals which necessarily must be heard by the Court of Appeal and those which fall outside of that category. Unlike the other subparagraphs within the Sixth Schedule, the criteria in paras 1(a)-(e) cannot be read as involving a purely factual inquiry because doing so would undermine the role of paras 1(a)-(e) in carving out specific categories or types of proceedings to be heard by the Court of Appeal

- We consider that “a case relating to” a specified subject matter in paras 1(a)-(e) is one where the latter is legally relevant to and/or has some bearing on the reliefs or orders which were sought at first instance

- At the very least, some reasonable relationship must be established between the specified subject matter and the “case” from which the appeal arises, whether with regard to the legal issues therein or the application of the law to its facts, in the court below, so that either or both of which may arise for consideration in the appeal. 

- For example, in the context of para 1(d), with which we are presently concerned, the “case” from which the appeal arises must concern a fact situation which involved the rules and principles relating to the law of insolvency, so that in the appeal, the Court of Appeal is also either called upon to decide a principle or rule relating to the law of insolvency (thereafter applying it to the facts concerned), or at the very least, apply an established principle or rule relating to the law of insolvency to the facts

- *The only criteria determinative of whether an appeal comes within paras 1(a)-(e) is whether it arises from “a case relating to” specified subject matter, and not the identity of the issues raised in the appeal itself. It is only consistent with the importance associated with these areas of law identified by the specified subject matter in paras 1(a)-(e) for any appeal satisfying the criteria therein to be made to the Court of Appeal by default, irrespective of the issues raised in the appeal 
--> i.e. it does not matter if the appeal turns on issues entirely unrelated to the specified subject matter, as long as the appeal has arisen from a “case” bearing the requisite relation to a specified subject matter, it is appealable to the CA

E.g. In the context of para 1(d) of the Sixth Schedule, an example will be an appeal involving the question of whether a winding-up order should be set aside on grounds entirely unrelated to the law of insolvency, such as non-disclosure of material facts or abuse of process. Notwithstanding that, the appeal will ultimately still entail the appellate court applying the established principles or rules of winding-up to the facts in determining if the winding-up order sought at first instance had been correctly made. Hence, in these situations, despite the complexion of the precise issues arising in the appeal, the appellate court will still be required to apply to the facts established principles or rules relating to the specified subject matter, in the same way that the court below had to when it granted or denied (as the case may be) the reliefs or orders sought in the “case” at first instance.



Transfer of appeals from ADHC to CA
1. Who can transfer appeal from ADHC to CA
2. Grounds of transfer 
a. Wrong filing ground
b. More appropriate ground
c. Issues on appeal 
3. Means of transferring 
4. Timelines and procedures for transfer 

Preliminary: CA has power to transfer any appeals from ADHC to CA  
CA may transfer “any appeal against GDHC decision to the ADHC” to itself
S29D(1) of SCJA
- The Court of Appeal may transfer the following appeals to itself:
a. Any appeal against any decision of the General Division that has been made to the Appellate Division;
b. Where an order under section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act 1966 is in force, any appeal made to the Appellate Division under section 29(2) or 38(2) of the Land Acquisition Act 1966.

3 Methods to trigger CA’s power under s29D(1) of SCJA
S29D(2) of SCJA
- The power in s29D(1) may be exercised by CA: 
a. Method 1: By CA own motion: On its own motion;
b. Method 2: By ADHC reference: On a reference by the Appellate Division; or
c. Method 3: By appellant/respondent: On an application to the Court of Appeal by any party to the appeal, but such an application may only be made:
(i) On the ground that the appeal was not made to the Appellate Division in accordance with section 29C; or
(ii) On grounds prescribed by the Rules of Court.

If Method 1 and Method 2 => 3 Grounds of Transfer 
S29D(3) => O 18 r 40(2)/O 19 r 39(2)
- Ground 1: Initial appeal to ADHC was not in accordance with s29C of SCJA (E.g. show that the matter falls under Sixth Schedule but was wrongly appealed to the ADHC) 
- Ground 2: It is more appropriate for CA than ADHC to hear the appeal 
- Ground 3: One or more of the legal issues raised in the appeal engage one or more of the matters in Sixth Schedule of SCJA 
* Difference between case that is being appealed and the issues that are being raised on appeal 

S29D(3) of SCJA
- In deciding whether to exercise powers under s29D(1), CA is to have regard to matters prescribed by Rules of Court

If Method 3 => 2 Grounds of Transfer 
S29D(2)(c)(i) 
- Ground 1: Initial appeal to ADHC was not in accordance with s29C of SCJA (E.g. show that the matter falls under Sixth Schedule but was wrongly appealed to the ADHC) 

S29D(2)(c)(ii) => O 18 r 40(1)/O 19 r 39(1) 
- Ground 2: It is more appropriate for CA than ADHC to hear the appeal 

Issue: How can Appellant/Respondent transfer appeal to ADHC to the CA? 
Step 1: s29D(2) of SCJA provides for Appellant/Respondent to transfer to CA any appeal to ADHC => Appellant/Respondent must make an application to the CA and satisfy the CA of one of the grounds of transfer in s29D(2) 
- Pursuant to s29D(1) of SCJA, the CA may transfer to itself any appeal against GDHC decision that has been made to the ADHC. The CA’s power under s29D(1) may be exercised on an application to the CA by the Appellant/Respondent. 

Step 2A: If Appellant/Respondent uses Ground 1 to transfer appeal to CA
Ground 1: Initial appeal to ADHC was not in accordance with s29C of SCJA (E.g. show that the matter falls under Sixth Schedule but was wrongly appealed to the ADHC)  
S29D(2)(c)(i) of SCJA: 
- Appellant/respondent may apply to the CA for CA to exercise its powers under s29D(1)(a) of SCJA to transfer an appeal that has been made to the ADHC on the ground that: 
* The appeal to ADHC was not in accordance with s29C of the SCJA 

Procedure for Ground 1 for both Order 18 and Order 19
Appellant/Respondent must make application to transfer under s29D(2)(c)(i) within 14 days after the date of service of Notice of Appeal + Application must also be made in accordance with Rule 35  
O 18 r 40(3)/O 19 r 39(3)
- An application under s29D(2)(c)(i) of SCJA must be made in accordance with Rule 35 and must be filed and served within 14 days after the date of service of the notice of appeal on all interested parties

Step 2B: If Appellant/Respondent uses Ground 2 to transfer appeal to CA  
Ground 2: Appellant/Respondent must show that it is more appropriate for CA than ADHC to hear the appeal 
Ground 2: More appropriate ground 
s29D(2)(c)(ii) of SCJA/O 18 r 40(1)/O 19 r 39(1)
- Appellant/respondent may apply to the CA for CA to exercise its powers under s29D(1)(a) of SCJA to transfer an appeal that has been made to the ADHC on the ground that: 
* It is more appropriate for the CA than the ADHC to hear the appeal  

Factors considered to determine whether it is more appropriate for CA than ADHC to hear appeal
O 18 r 40(5)/O 19 r 39(5)
- When determining whether it is more appropriate for CA to hear an appeal that has been made to the ADHC, the CA may have regard to one or more of the following matters:
a. Proceedings relate to matter of national or public importance: Whether the proceedings relate to a matter of national or public importance;
b. Appeal raises point of law of public importance: Whether the appeal will raise a point of law of public importance;
c. Complexity and novelty of issues: The complexity and novelty of the issues in the appeal;
d. Previous CA decision relevant to a point of law that is material to current matter: Whether there is a decision of the Court of Appeal in relation to a point of law raised in the appeal which may be material to the outcome of the appeal;
e. Presence of conflicting judicial decisions: Whether there are conflicting judicial decisions;
f. Significance of results of proceedings: The significance of the results of the proceedings;
g. Any other relevant matter

Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd [2021] SGCA 59 
Whether the proceedings relate to a matter of national or public importance
Cases that involve issues of fact and law which are of national or public importance 

The matters of national and public importance do not necessarily have to arise squarely for the Court’s determination and do not need to have a substantial bearing on the outcome of the appeal 

National and public importance means that the case will not only affect a segment of society, but has the potential to impact Singapore on a macro-level 
Whether the appeal will raise a point of law of public importance
Point of law of public importance must be a live issue which has a substantial bearing on the outcome of the appeal 
- It cannot be a hypothetical or merely theoretical question which is peripheral or irrelevant to the appeal 

Point of law is an issue that is normative in nature and would apply generally or universally to other similar situations
- Point of fact is an issue that is necessarily confined or limited to the case at hand 

Point of law of public importance 
- New questions of law of general application 
- New questions of law that involve conflicting decisions of CA or ADHC which need to be resolved so as to bring certainty to significant areas of law 
The complexity and novelty of the issues in the appeal
Issues must be live and must have a substantial bearing on the outcome of the appeal 
- It cannot be a hypothetical or merely theoretical question which is peripheral or irrelevant to the appeal 

Novelty
- Mere fact that an issue has not arisen before in the same exact form does not immediately render the issue sufficiently novel
=> All issues are novel if framed with sufficient specificity 

Complexity
- Bear in mind that the increasing complexity of mattes in CA’s docket is one of the reasons that prompted establishment of ADHC in the first place 
Whether there is a decision of the Court of Appeal in relation to a point of law raised in the appeal which may be material to the outcome of the appeal
The prior decision of the CA must have a substantial bearing on the outcome of the appeal 
- It cannot be a hypothetical or merely theoretical question which is peripheral or irrelevant to the appeal 

The significance of the results of the proceeding
No indication as to who or what the outcome matters => Limb may be satisfied if the determination of the appeal will only affect the parties concerned if the results are of substantial and critical consequence to them 
- High and exceptional degree of personal consequences

“Demonstrating some personal interest in the results of the appeal” is insufficient as it would be too broad as to be meaningless as all appeals will fulfil this limb

Step 2B: Order 19 – Appellant must apply for permission from CA to appeal to the CA
S47(1) of SCJA 
- An appeal against a decision of the Appellate Division made in the exercise of its appellate civil jurisdiction may only be brought with the permission of the Court of Appeal.

Part 1: Appellant must satisfy 2 requirements for CA grant permission to appeal to CA
O 18 r 29(5)/O 19 r 26(5)
- Where permission to appeal under section 47(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act is required, the Court of Appeal may grant permission to appeal against a decision of the Appellate Division, where:
a. Requirement 1: Appeal must raise point of law of public importance: The appeal will raise a point of law of public importance; AND
b. Requirement 2: It is appropriate for CA to hear the appeal considering relevant matters including: It is appropriate for the Court of Appeal to hear a further appeal, having regard to all relevant matters, including either or both of the following:
(i) Consideration 1: Whether CA decision is required to resolve point of law: Whether a decision of the Court of Appeal is required to resolve the point of law;
(ii) Consideration 2: Whether interests of administration of justice generally or in the particular case requires CA to consider the point of law: Whether the interests of the administration of justice, either generally or in the particular case, require the Court of Appeal’s consideration of the point of law

S47(2) of SCJA 
- Point of law of public importance: The Court of Appeal may grant permission under subsection (1) only if the appeal will raise a point of law of public importance.

S47(3) of SCJA
- In deciding whether to grant permission under subsection (1) or in determining, for the purposes of subsection (2), whether an appeal will raise a point of law of public importance, the Court of Appeal is to have regard to matters prescribed by the Rules of Court.

Principles on Requirement 1
Principle 1: CA can exercise discretion to not grant permission even if point of law of public importance
s47(4)(a) of SCJA
- The Court of Appeal is not required to grant permission under subsection (1) even if the appeal will raise a point of law of public importance; and
 
Principle 2: “point of law of public importance” has a very high threshold 
Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd [2021] SGCA 59 
- In vast majority of cases, ADHC will serve as the final appellate Court 
- However, ADHC is not the apex court and some of its decisions can be subject to appeal to the CA only if leave is granted by the CA under s47 of the SCJA on the basis that the appeal will raise a point of law of public importance 
- Point of law of public importance under s47 of SCJA 
d. Threshold is higher than that under O 18 r 40(5)/O 19 r 39(5) which is for transfers of appeal between ADHC and CA 
e. Threshold is higher than the principles governing applications for leave to appeal against GDHC decision 
f. Leave will only be granted in rare circumstances 
- Reason: ADHC is not a further tier of appeal that must be crossed before a matter can reach the CA, the ADHC is meant to share in the workload and not delay it

Evidence on Appeal
Introduction of Fresh Evidence on Appeal (Appeal hearing in ADHC) 
Parties may only give Further Evidence on Appeal in ADHC if any 2 scenarios exist 
S41(4) of SCJA
- Further evidence may only be given to ADHC in appeal hearing if: 
* Scenario 1: ADHC has given permission and on special grounds; OR 
* Scenario 2: If provided for in s41(5)

Introduction of Fresh Evidence on Appeal (Appeal hearing in CA) 
Parties may only give Further Evidence on Appeal in CA if any 2 scenarios exist 
S59(4) of SCJA
- Further evidence may only be given to CA in appeal hearing if: 
* Scenario 1: CA has given permission and on special grounds; OR 
* Scenario 2: If provided for in s59(5)

Principles underlying Scenario 1: ADHC/CA has given permission and on special grounds 
Part 1: As a general rule, the party seeking Court’s permission to admit further evidence pursuant to special grounds must satisfy 3 cumulative requirements in Ladd v Marshall 
BNX v BOE 
- The special grounds for Court to grant leave to admit further evidence in an appeal are defined by 3 cumulative conditions laid out in Ladd v Marshall:
1. Requirement 1: Non-availability at Lower Court: Evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use in the lower Court 
=> Can be disapplied using Anan Group exception
2. Requirement 2: Relevance and materiality to the case: Evidence would probably have an important influence on the result of the case although it need not be decisive 
3. Requirement 3: Credibility or reliability of evidence: Evidence must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible 

Part 2A: However, the Court in Anan Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd has endorsed a 2-Stage framework to assess if any requirement in Ladd v Marshall can be disapplied 
Anan Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v VB Bank (Public Joint Stock Co) 
Stage 1: Consider the nature of the proceedings below and evaluate the extent to which it bears the characteristics of a full trial and whether it more closely resembles an interlocutory appeal 
- Resembles full trial => Apply full Ladd v Marshall
- Hearing not on the merits => Apply Ladd v Marshall as a guideline 
- Hearing on interlocutory matter => First Ladd v Marshall requirement of non-availability is relaxed because interlocutory matters are “contested at an early stage of the litigation where it may be unjust to expect a party to have all his tackle in order” 
- Middle of spectrum => Consider nature of proceedings to determine if the first Ladd v Marshall condition of non-availability should be strictly applied => Nature of proceedings such as:
a. Extent to which documentary and oral evidence was adduced for the purpose of the hearing 
b. Extent to which parties had the opportunities to revisit and refine their cases before the hearing 
c. Finality of the proceedings in disposing of the dispute between the parties 

Stage 2: Consider if there are any other reasons why Ladd v Marshall should be disapplied in the interests of justice
- Whether fresh evidence reveals fraud perpetuated in lower Court 
- Whether party was prevented from adducing fresh evidence in lower Court akin to denial of natural justice
- Whether stakes of the dispute were particularly high or where there were public interests involved e.g. child welfare, criminal proceedings, judicial review cases, patent disputes 

Final balancing exercise to decide if Ladd v Marshall should be disapplied 
- Finality of proceedings and entitlement of a successful party to rely on a judgement in his favor vs Right of party to put forth relevant and credible evidence 
- Proportionality in prejudice:
a. Whether evidence sought to be adduced can be addressed by way of a reply affidavit for which any prejudice can be compensated by costs
b. Whether interests would be irreparably harm if fresh evidence is not allowed 

Part 2B: However the Court in BNX v BOE  also discussed several exceptional situations where the Court would be entitled to admit further evidence on appeal even if any of the requirements in Ladd v Marshall are not met 
BNX v BOE
- There are certain exceptional circumstances where Court would be entitled to admit further evidence on appeal even though the Ladd v Marshall criteria might not be met: 
a. Situation 1: Party denied fair opportunity to put forth relevant facts in Lower Court: Where a party has been denied a fair opportunity by the trial judge to put forth relevant facts before the Court 
b. Situation 2: Lower Court made decision on a new point which parties no opportunity to address: Where the trial judge made a decision on a new point of a substantial nature that the parties did not have the opportunity to address
c. Situation 3: Fresh evidence uncovers fraud or deception of opposing party: Where the fresh evidence uncovers fraud or deception of the other party and such fraud strikes at the very root of the litigation 

Principles underlying Scenario 2: If provided for in s41(5)/s59(5) of SCJA 
Part 1: Following s41(5)/s59(5), further evidence may be given on appeal without Court’s permission if evidence relates to matters after date of Lower Court decision 
S41(5) of SCJA 
- Such further evidence may be given to the ADHC without permission if: 
* The evidence relates to matters occurring after the date of the decision appealed against

S59(5) of SCJA 
- Such further evidence may be given to the Court of Appeal without permission if: 
* The evidence relates to matters occurring after the date of the decision appealed against

Part 2: In BNX v BOE, Court held that even though s41(5)/s59(5) may be satisfied in relation to a piece of further evidence, it can only be admitted as evidence if it satisfies 3 additional conditions in BNX v BOE
BNX v BOE
- In assessing whether further evidence produced under s41(5)/s59(5) can be admitted as evidence, the Court would have to: 
1. Condition 1: Ensure that evidence is only given for matters that occur after trial below: Ascertain what the relevant matters are, of which evidence is sought to be given and ensure that these are matters that occurred after the trial or hearing below
2. Condition 2: Ensure that evidence is at least potentially material to the issues in the appeal: Satisfy itself that the evidence of these matters is at least potentially material to the issues in the appeal
3. Condition 3: Ensure that evidence at least appears credible: Satisfy itself that the material at least appears to be credible

*C. ENFORCEMENT OF COURT ORDERS 
Preliminary: Why should Judgement Creditor apply for Enforcement Order? 
- Enforcement Order: Enables Judgement Creditor to enforce the judgement against the Judgement Debtor by using tools like garnishee orders, seizure and sale orders etc. 

*Stay of enforcement
General rule: a court order takes effect from its date, and the filing of an appeal would NOT operate automatically to stay enforcement (O 18 r 6; O 19 r 6)

An enforcement respondent who wishes enforcement to be stayed need to apply for a stay order (via O 22 r 13 ROC), which would then be a discretionary measure for the court. It would usually require a showing of special circumstances – which go to the enforcement of the court order, and not the court order’s validity or correctness. 
- The stay order can be applied on the ground that there is a special case making it inappropriate to enforce the court order immediately (O 22 r 13(1) ROC) or pending appeal (s45(1) and 60C SCJA)
- E.g. a successful appeal could be rendered nugatory if a stay is not imposed in the mean time

Lee Kuan Yew v JBJ:
- The court’s power to grant a stay is entirely in the discretion of the court, but the discretion must be exercised in accordance with established principles
- Where a judgement was given after a FULL TRIAL (cf summary judgement or judgement in default) and an unsuccessful defendant had a full opportunity to present his case, the court should NOT deprive a successful plaintiff of the fruits of his victory pending an appeal, unless the unsuccessful defendant can show some special circumstances to justify granting of a stay
- E.g. of special circumstance: shown by affidavit that unless a stay is granted, a successful appeal could be nugatory – i.e. then the defendant would be disadvantaged if his appeal is successful. 
- There might be the likelihood of judgement creditor becoming insolvent before the disposal of the appeal, or the circumstances might be such that if the judgement debt and costs are paid (from the debtor to creditor), there is no reasonable probability of the judgement debtor getting them back if the appeal succeeds.

*Mareva injunction post-judgement to aid execution of court orders / judgement debt
JTrust Asia v Group Lease Holdings
- Conditions for the grant of a Mareva injunction post-judgement: the Court must be satisfied that – 
(a) there is a real risk of the debtor dissipating his assets with the intention of depriving the creditor of satisfaction of the judgment debt;
(b) the injunction must act as an aid to execution of court order/judgement; AND 
--> injunction will NOT be allowed for ulterior motives like to oppress the enjoined party
(c) it must be in the interests of justice to grant the injunction 
--> e.g. Judgment Sum and cost orders have already been ordered in favour of the appellant and there is no injustice in enjoining the sum required to ensure that the Judgment Sum is promptly paid to the appellant 

*Step 1: Application for Enforcement Order
Enforcement Applicant may apply to Court for Enforcement Order

(iii) Deposit the amount of money requested by the Sheriff before the Sheriff complies with the enforcement order and from time to time,

(b) After an order of the Court for satisfaction to be recorded is made under O 22 r 3 --> NB: any person who has satisfied a judgment debt may on filing a consent of the judgment creditor in Form 39 apply to the Court for satisfaction to be recorded, and the Court may order satisfaction to be recorded accordingly

*Carrying out of Enforcement Order by Sheriff 
Sheriff must carry out the sequence of acts indicated in enforcement order
If Enforcement Order indicates sequence of acts => Sheriff must carry out the sequence
O 22 r 6(1) 
- The Sheriff must carry out the terms of the enforcement order in the sequence indicated (if any) in the enforcement order and at the time, place and in the manner determined by the Sheriff, and may exercise any powers under any written law relating to forced entry into premises
=> Note: If judgment debtor has large known bank accounts which can satisfy the judgement debt then should sequence the attachment of debt/garnishee order first, before the seizure and sale of other properties

E.g. of Sequence 
- If Enforcement Respondent has money in banks: Enforcement order should require Sheriff to first attach debt/garnishee order before seizure and sale of money in bank 

If Enforcement Order does not indicate sequence of acts => Sheriff has discretion to decide 
O 22 r 6(2)

c. Objector must notify Sheriff of case and application number within 7 days after application: Give notice in writing to the Sheriff of the case and application number of the summons filed, within 7 days after making the application

Para 142 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- If enforcement applicant fails to respond within 14 days of notice of objection => Sheriff direct objector to apply to Court => Objector must within 7 days after direction, file summons in Form 40 of Appendix B of PD + Affidavit => Summons and affidavit must be served on enforcement applicant, enforcement respondent and any non-party served with notice of seizure or attachment 

*Sheriff’s rights and obligations when objector objects

O 22 r 10(6)
- The Sheriff may provide to the enforcement applicant, the enforcement respondent or any other person upon request such information relating to the seizure or attachment as is appropriate

Sheriff must not sell any property that is in dispute

O 22 r 10(8)
- The Sheriff may seek the Court’s directions by letter at any time.

*Can garnishee order/attachment be made over joint account held by judgement debtor and innocent party?
Previously cannot under One Investment and Consultancy Ltd
- Previously, One Investment and Consultancy Ltd [2016] SGHC 208 stood for general proposition that joint account held in the names of a judgement debtor and an innocent party jointly cannot be subject to attachment under a garnishee order 

Recently, Timing Ltd indicated that a provisional garnishee order can be issued under certain conditions to prevent judgement debtor from ring-fencing his money in the joint account  
- Recently, Timing Ltd [2020] SGHC 169 indicated that provisional garnishee orders could be issued under certain conditions => Provisional garnishee orders can prevent judgement debtor from ring-fencing his assets by transferring his funds into a joint account with a 3rd party pending determination of final garnishee order 
- Conditions: 
a. There is strong prima facie evidence that all the money in the joint account belongs to the judgement debtor
b. Notice is given to the innocent joint account holder by the show cause hearing (to determine final provisional order) 
c. Judgement creditor provides undertaking to pay any costs and reasonably foreseeable losses of garnishee or joint account holder should it be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the money in the joint account is not in fact payable in whole or in part to the judgement debtor 

Timing Ltd indicated that a final garnishee order will be issued if judgement creditor can show on a balance of probabilities that judgement debtor solely owned money in joint account 
- However, Timing Ltd [2021] SGHC 5 says that a final garnishee order can only be issued if judgement creditor shows on a balance of probabilities that:
* The judgement debtor solely owned the money in the joint account
a. Look at contributions => Look at PRT => Whether PRT rebutted by contrary intention or POA => Whether POA rebutted by contrary intention 
 
One Investment and Consultancy Ltd v Champ Poh Meng (DBS Bank Ltd, garnishee) 
- Joint account held in the names of a judgement debtor and an innocent party jointly cannot be subject to attachment under a garnishee order 
- Reasons: 
a. Prejudice to banks: 
(i) There is no framework for banks to assess each joint holder’s contributions and stake in the joint account and to require banks to make such assessment could expose them to being sued by non-party joint account holders 
(ii) Even if a framework is to be adopted, there would be increased operational and legal costs of compliance imposed on the banks => Such costs could be borne by judgement creditors and debtors => Imposing a further barrier to justice 
b. Prejudice to non-party joint account holders:
(i) There is no framework for a joint account holder to assert his share in the joint account, no requirement for innocent joint account holder to be notified and no mechanism for innocent joint account holder to seek determination of judgement debtor’s interest in the joint account => Implication: Garnishee order could be made final, and the sum specified be deducted even before the innocent joint holder is notified. Even if innocent joint holder is notified, he has no recourse other than to object to the bank or incur substantial legal cost by objecting to garnishee proceedings in Court
(ii) Even if judgement debtor’s contribution is determined as half => There is a decision to freeze half of the account was made => Judgement debtor joint account holder can just withdraw the other half that is not frozen => Innocent joint holder will be forced to shoulder the whole of the judgement debt as all that would be left is the frozen money 

Timing Ltd v Tay Toh Hin [2020] SGHC 169 
- Exception to grant provisional garnishee order: Provisional garnishee orders could be issued against joint accounts if:
a. There is strong prima facie evidence that all the money in the joint account belongs to the judgement debtor
b. Notice is given to the innocent joint account holder by the show cause hearing (to determine final provisional order) 
c. Judgement creditor provides undertaking to pay any costs and reasonably foreseeable losses of garnishee or joint account holder should it be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the money in the joint account is not in fact payable in whole or in part to the judgement debtor 
- Held: Strong prima facie case was established as judgement debtor himself admitted that the money in the joint bank accounts were paid to him personally and belonged solely to him 
- To prevent provisional garnishee order: After strong prima facie evidence is provided, judgement debtor and innocent joint account holder has evidential burden and must adduce evidence to prove the contrary 

Timing Ltd v Tay Toh Hin [2021] SGHC 5 
- Requirements to obtain final garnishee order: Final garnishee order will only be issued against joint accounts if judgement creditor shows on a balance of probabilities that the judgement debtor solely owned the money in the joint account:
a. Look at contributions => Look at PRT => Whether PRT rebutted by contrary intention or POA => Whether POA rebutted by contrary intention 
- Held: Fail to establish on a BOP that all the money in the joint account belonged beneficially to the judgement debtor: 
a. Other joint account holder is wife of judgement debtor and wife had no other accounts in Singapore which were not jointly held with judgement debtor => It would be odd in the case of a 36 year marriage where there was no separation of money between the couple if there was no mutual intent on the couple that the wife should have a beneficial interest in the money in the joint account 
b. Even though PRT for husband => There was strong POA operated in favor of the wife because of closeness of relationship between husband and wife and financial dependence of wife on husband

*Examination of Enforcement Respondent (previously called EJD – enforcement of judgement debtor)
Preliminary: Why should Judgement Creditor apply for Examination of Enforcement Respondent?  
- If judgement creditor finds it difficult to enforce judgement or enforcement order against judgement debtor because he does not know what assets the judgement debtor has => Judgement creditor can use EER to find out about the judgement debtor’s assets 

Preliminary: Check if judgement debtor has applied for a stay of enforcement of Court order pending appeal => If so, Enforcement Applicant will be precluded from applying for EER 
Reason: Application of EER is deemed to be an enforcement of Court order 
O 22 r 11(4)
- An application under this Rule is deemed to be enforcement of a Court order and is within the terms of any written law or any order staying enforcement of that Court order
=> Implication: EER cannot be enforced if there is a stay of enforcement application made by the enforcement respondent 

O 22 r 11(4) reverses previous position in case law 
- This reverses the previous position in PT Bakrie Investindo v Global Distressed Alpha Fund 1. Ltd Partnership which held that an order staying execution of a judgement pending appeal would not bar an EJD order which is depicted as a mere information-gathering tool 

*Step 1: Effect of EER 
Enforcement Respondent will be examined orally in Court or will make an affidavit on properties owned by him
O 22 r 11(1) 
- Enforcement Applicant may apply: 
* For Enforcement Respondent to be examined orally in Court or to make an affidavit on the properties owned by him => Whether beneficially in whole or in part or which the Enforcement Respondent will be entitled to in the future

Enforcement Respondent will be made to produce documents as are appropriate
O 22 r 11(2) 
- Enforcement Applicant may apply: 
* For Enforcement Respondent to produce documents as appropriate 

*Step 2: Application for EER
Enforcement Applicant may apply to Court for EER
O 22 r 11(1) 
- The enforcement applicant may apply for the enforcement respondent to be examined orally in court or to make an affidavit or both on the properties which are owned by the enforcement respondent beneficially whether in whole or in part or which the enforcement respondent will be entitled to in the future

Procedure to apply for EER 
Enforcement Applicant must make ex partes application to Court   
- Ex partes application for Court to grant order for EER 

In the application - Enforcement Applicant’s duty to provide full and frank disclosure 
The “Vasiliy Golovnin” 
- In the ex partes application: Applicant must disclose to the court all matters within his knowledge which might be material even if they are prejudicial to the applicant’s claim 

Court can grant leave to serve EER out of jurisdiction on a foreign officer of Enforcement Respondent (entity)
Test: Whether foreign officer was so closely connected with substantive claim that Singapore Court is justified in taking jurisdiction over foreign officer 
Burgundy Global Exploration Corp v Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd 
- Court’s discretion to grant leave to serve EER out of jurisdiction must be exercised sparingly 
- Test: Whether the foreign officer was so closely connected to the substantive claim that the Singapore Court is justified in taking jurisdiction over the foreign officer
a. Extent of foreign officer’s knowledge of enforcement respondent’s financial affairs
b. Extent of foreign officer’s involvement in matters relating to the claim 

*Step 3: After Court issues EER order, Enforcement Applicant must enforce EER by personally serving EER order on Enforcement Respondent  
Enforcement Applicant must personally serve EER Order (Form 41) on Enforcement Respondent
O 22 r 11(5)
- An order under this Rule must be in Form 41 and must be served personally on the enforcement respondent 

Enforcement Applicant must annex questionnaire (Form 41 or Form 42) to EER order for personal service 
Para 145 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Questionnaire in the manner and form in Form 41 or 42 of Appendix B of PD must be annexed to order for examination of enforcement when the order is served on the enforcement respondent or its officers 
a. Form 41: For individual enforcement respondent 
b. Form 42: For officers of enforcement respondent entities 

Additional rules if Enforcement Respondent is an entity
If Enforcement Respondent is an entity => EER must state officers of entity who will be examined 
O 22 r 11(3)
- Where the enforcement respondent is an entity, the order must state the appointment of the officer or officers of the entity who are to be examined

If Enforcement Respondent is an entity => Form 41 must be personally served on any officer of entity who is ordered to attend examination hearing  
O 22 r 11(5)
- Where the enforcement respondent is an entity, Form 41 must be served personally on any officer of the entity ordered to attend for examination.

*Step 4A: If Enforcement Respondent completes questionnaire and serves completed questionnaire and supporting documents on Enforcement Applicant satisfactorily => Enforcement Applicant can request Enforcement Respondent provide their answers via affidavit or statutory declaration => Enforcement Applicant can apply to discharge EER Order => Hearing will not be held 
Para 145 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Enforcement respondent need not attend at hearing if: 
a. He provides his answers to the questionnaire to the enforcement applicant by way of an affidavit or statutory declaration before the hearing 
b. The enforcement applicant agrees to apply for a discharge of the order for EER at the hearing 

*Step 4B: If Enforcement Respondent objects to questionnaire or refuses to comply satisfactorily => Enforcement Respondent must try to resolve issues with Enforcement Applicant before hearing => If not, parties have to go for examination hearing at the date and time in the EER Order 
Para 145 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- If enforcement respondent objects to any question in questionnaire on ground that it is unreasonable => Enforcement respondent must contact enforcement applicant to ascertain whether issue can be resolved prior to hearing 

*Step 5: At the examination hearing, Enforcement Applicant may examine Enforcement Respondent in relation to Enforcement Respondent’s assets => Enforcement Respondent needs to answer relevant questions under oath and produce supporting documents => Enforcement Applicant can request for Enforcement Respondent to file affidavit or statutory declaration => Enforcement Applicant can discharge EER Order 
Para 145 of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- At hearing, answered questionnaire is produced to Registrar and received as evidence upon the enforcement respondent’s confirmation on oath that his answers are true and correct => Enforcement applicant may then apply to discharge EER

Step 5: Issuance of enforcement order by Court 
O 60 r 10
(1) Enforcement order issued after period to set aside registration expired: An enforcement order must not be issued to enforce a judgment registered under the first Act or second Act until after the expiration of the period which, in accordance with Rule 5(2), is specified in the order for registration as the period within which an application may be made to set aside the registration or (if that period has been extended by the Court) until after the expiration of that period as so extended.

*D. COSTS
As a general rule, as part of the court’s discretion on costs, the court will order that COSTS SHOULD FOLLOW THE EVENT (i.e. winning party gets paid its costs), unless there are circumstances justifying departure from this general rule.
E.g. despite having won the outcome, the winning party acted very unreasonably during proceedings – so the court may not grant winning party its costs, or to grant costs with a large discount

*What is considered a cost in contentious legal business? 
Definition of “costs” and “contentious business” 
O 21 r 1(2)
- Contentious business: Same definition as per s2(1) of Legal Profession Act 
- Costs: Includes fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration 

S2(1) of LPA
- Contentious business: Business done in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court of justice or before an arbitrator
- Wide definition: not just during court proceeding but includes actions in pre-action period, so includes letter of demand and drafting of statement of claim

Examples of costs for contentious business
Legis Point LLC v Tay Choon Ai
- The following costs considered as costs for contentious business => Will be taken into consideration when Court orders P&P costs:
a. Costs incurred in preparation of writ of summons and statement of claim 
b. Costs incurred as part of preparation for without prejudice negotiations prior to filing of writ 
(i) Review of documents and drafting of correspondence
(ii) Attendance in settlement negotiations with opposing party
(iii) Even though the negotiations were without prejudice, the very existence of negotiations can still be raised to the Court in determination of P&P costs 
c. Costs incurred in respect of mediation after writ is filed 
(i) There were existing court proceedings here as writ was filed and the mediation work to settle could be described as incidental to court proceedings 

*Difference between S&C costs and P&P costs
S&C costs: Costs that are payable by a party to his own solicitor in relation to work done by the solicitor in respect of a contentious or non-contentious matter
- Usually based on whatever is agreed in the Letter of Engagement between party and his solicitor 
- Payable regardless of outcome of case 

P&P costs: Costs payable by “losing party” to “winning party” after Court has given judgement 
- Party paying P&P costs depends on outcome of case 

Interaction between S&C costs and P&P costs 
1. Party’s obligation to pay S&C costs is independent of whether party can recover P&P costs
a. Agreement to tag S&C costs payable to whether P&P costs is recoverable is illegal => Indirectly makes S&C costs subject to whether solicitor wins the case 
b. Agreement to limit quantum of S&C costs payable to quantum of P&P costs awarded to either party is legal (Legis Point LLC) --> i.e. capping S&C costs at amount of P&P costs eventually awarded to either party is OK, because the S&C cost would be payable anyways even if P&P costs is awarded or not 

2. Quantum of P&P costs recovered by winning party cannot be more than the quantum of S&C costs payable by the winning party to his solicitor (s112(2) LPA) 
a. Reason: P&P costs are supposed to be compensatory to compensate the winning party’s legal costs and they are not supposed to give winning party a windfall 

3. Quantum of P&P costs recovered by winning party usually represent a portion of S&C costs payable by winning party to his solicitor (Maryani Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani) 
a. Reason for P&P costs to not be equal to S&C costs: The cost regime is not just concerned with compensation but is also interested in enhancing access to justice for all and thus the P&P costs payable by losing party should not be so high that it would be overly prohibitive on risk-averse claimants who have meritorious claims 

*Entitlement to P&P costs 
3 sources of a party’s entitlement to costs from another party 
1. Legislation 
2. Contract 
3. Judgement or Court order (see below)

Legislation 
- Certain legislative provisions give a party the right to demand for P&P costs from another party upon the occurrence of certain defined events without the need for any extra Court order 

Recovery of money payable to SAL 
S25 of Singapore Academy of Law Act
- The Senate may recover any subscription or other moneys due and payable to the Academy and any interest thereon as a debt due to the Academy and the Academy is entitled to the payment of its full costs as between solicitor and client.

Costs of making amendments without permission => Paid by party making amendment
O 21 r 3(3)
- The costs of and occasioned by any amendment made without permission in the originating claim or any pleadings must be borne by the party making the amendment unless the Court otherwise orders.

Costs of applications for time extension => Paid by party making application
O 21 r 3(4)
- The costs of and occasioned by any application to extend the time fixed by these Rules or the Court, for serving or filing any document or doing any other act must be borne by the party making the application, unless the Court otherwise orders.

Costs of trustee, PR, mortgagee who act on behalf of a party in proceedings => Paid by trust fund, PR, mortgaged property
O 21 r 3(5)
- Where a person is or has been a party to any proceedings in the capacity of trustee, personal representative or mortgagee, that person is, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitled to the costs of those proceedings, insofar as they are not recovered from or paid by any other person, out of the fund held by the trustee or personal representative or out of the mortgaged property, as the case may be.

Where Claimant discontinues action or claim against Defendant without permission => Claimant has to pay Defendant’s cost of action 
O 21 r 9(1)
- Where:
a. A claimant by notice in writing and without permission either wholly discontinues the claimant’s action against any defendant or withdraws any particular claim made by the claimant in an action against any defendant; or
b. An action is deemed discontinued,
the defendant is, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitled to the defendant’s costs of the action or claim incurred to the time of discontinuance, which may be assessed if not agreed between the parties, and the defendant may sign judgment for the defendant’s assessed costs after 48 hours after assessment.

Contract 
Examples of party’s contractual entitlement to costs 
- Contract providing for legal costs to be paid by one party to another in the event of a dispute 
- Contract providing basis for how legal costs should be computed in the event of a dispute  
- Contract providing for no cost-shifting i.e. if matter goes to Court, each party will bear its own cost 

Principle 1: Party enforcing costs agreement must clearly and properly plead it as a cause of action 
Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd v Credit Agricole (Suisse) SA (Yeh Mao-Yuan, third party) 
- Claim for costs under court’s ordinary statutory discretion need not be pleaded because costs issue will naturally arise in all cases at the end of the hearing 
- But if party wants to enforce its contractual rights directly under a costs agreement, such a cause of action would have to be clearly and properly pleaded 

Abani Trading Pte Ltd v BNP Paribas 
- Clause 11.4 provides for costs on an indemnity basis:
“The Borrower shall fully indemnify and keep indemnified the Bank (at its head office and any and all branches of the Bank), its agents, sub-agents, Affiliates and every director, officer, employee or agent of any of the foregoing against any and all losses, damages, reasonable costs and expenses (including but not limited to legal costs on a full indemnity basis), charges, actions, suits, proceedings, orders, warrants, injunctions, claims or demands which may be brought against any of them or which any of them may suffer or incur in connection with or arising from (i) the provision of any Facilities or the Borrower’s account(s) held with the Bank or its Affiliates, or (ii) any transaction referable to, involving or relating to the Borrower or the Facilities or the Borrower’s account(s) held with the Bank or its Affiliates ... save where the same arises directly from their respective gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud. ..”
- Issue: Whether a claim for costs on an indemnity basis has to be specifically pleaded? 
- Held: Undecided but it is prudent to do so for contractual provisions 
1. Where claim for indemnity cost is premised entirely on a contractual provision governing both parties => It would be prudent for party who intends to rely on the contractual provision to specifically plead it => Avoids any argument that the other party was taken by surprised or prejudiced because of lack of notice 
2. Include the contractual provision in pleadings to allow other party to make informed decision whether there is a need to adduce evidence to address enforceability of the contractual provision 

Principle 2: Legal uncertainty as to the ways for party to enforce costs agreement 
Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd v Credit Agricole (Suisse) SA (Yeh Mao-Yuan, third party) 
- Currently 2 ways for party to enforce costs agreement: 
1. Sue directly under contractual agreement on the basis that the agreement ousts the Court’s statutory discretion to award costs 
2. Rely on the Court’s discretion but to assert that the costs agreement is a relevant factor in determining the basis of the award 
- Legal issues which arise from the 2 ways: 
a. Inequality in the 2 ways of enforcement: In Abani Trading, where Court’s statutory discretion to award costs is invoked, Court may disregard contractual agreement between the parties if it would be manifestly unjust to uphold the agreement => It is unclear whether Court can also invoke the same discretion when asked to directly enforce a contractual agreement on costs between two commercial parties. Especially when Courts ordinarily cannot disregard contractual rights purely on grounds of hardship or unfairness 

Principle 3: Indemnity clauses requiring a party to fully indemnify another party regardless of whether indemnified party wins suit is unfair and would require clear and express language to be effective  
Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd v Credit Agricole (Suisse) SA (Yeh Mao-Yuan, third party) 
- A clause that requires the borrower to indemnify the bank against legal costs arising out of a borrower’s successful suit against the bank => It is a clause that grants full indemnity to the bank against any litigation by the borrower even if the bank was truly guilty of wrongdoing and this is uncommercial, unfair and unreasonable => Far clearer and mor express language would have to be used to achieve that effect 
*By Judgment or Court order 
If not from legislation or contract, a party is only entitled to recover costs of proceedings from any other party pursuant to a Court order 
O 21 r 3(1) 
- Except where expressly provided for by legislation or contract, no party is entitled to recover any costs of or incidental to any proceedings from any other party to the proceedings except under an order of the Court 

Costs are at Court’s discretion and can be sought at any stage of proceedings
O 21 r 2(1) 
- Subject to any written law, costs are in the discretion of the Court and the Court has the power to determine all issues relating to the costs of or incidental to all proceedings in the Supreme Court or the State Courts at any stage of the proceedings or after the conclusion of the proceedings.

In practice: Court will make costs orders at the end of each interlocutory stage and at the end of proceedings 
Note: 
- In practice: After each interlocutory stage, Court will ask parties to make submissions on cost orders for that particular interlocutory stage => Court will then make costs orders for that interlocutory stage 
- Parties can also request for Court to make costs orders at end of proceedings 
Costs orders are consequential orders and has to be sought within the same or related proceedings (Chin Yoke Choong Bobby v Hong Lam Marine). 
- Thus, costs payable by any party to any other party in any matter must be fixed by the Court which heard the matter, unless the Court thinks fit to direct an assessment of the costs (O 21 r 2(3) ROC).

In exercising its power to fix or assess costs, the Court must have regard to all relevant circumstances, including:
O 21 r 2(2) 
- In exercising its power to fix or assess costs, the Court must have regard to all relevant circumstances, including:
a. Efforts to reach amicable resolution: Efforts made by the parties at amicable resolution;
b. Complexity of case and novelty of questions: The complexity of the case and the difficulty or novelty of the questions involved;
c. Skill, specialized knowledge, time labor expended by solicitor: The skill, specialised knowledge and responsibility required of, and the time and labour expended by, the solicitor
d. Urgency and importance of action to parties: The urgency and importance of the action to the parties;
e. Number of solicitors involved: The number of solicitors involved in the case for each party;
f. Parties’ conduct: The conduct of the parties;
g. Proportionality: The principle of proportionality; and
h. Stage which proceedings conclude: The stage at which the proceedings were concluded

*Step 1: Court’s starting point when determining party’s percentage entitlement to costs is the principle that – Costs follows the event 
Costs follows the event: Unsuccessful party will have to pay the legal costs of the successful party 
O 21 r 3(2) 
- The Court must, subject to this Order, order the costs of any proceedings in favour of a successful party, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs
Exceptions – 
- Ex parte applications – applicant always pays unless contested 
- 3p exceptions – e.g. application for 3p interrogatories – applicant pays 3p’s costs 
- Amendment of pleadings – usually the amending party pays 

Determining who is the “successful party”
Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd – Claimant successful party even though he only recovered 26% of its claim, succeeded in two out of six issues and partially succeeded in another two 
- Held: Plaintiff was the “successful party” in the action as the First Defendant must pay a substantial sum to the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff would not have recovered that substantial sum if it had not succeeded in claims against the First Defendant  
1. Even though:
a. Plaintiff recovered only 26% of its $1.5mil claim
b. Plaintiff had secured an unqualified success on only two of the six issues and partial success on another two  
c. The two issues were minor both in terms of quantum and costs 
Principle – not a numbers game, court will look at substance over form. E.g. number of days taken for a small-quantum issue may outweigh the value of a large-quantum issue that was decided within 1 day of trial 

Alfro-Asia Shipping v Da Zhong Investment – Defendant successful party as Claimant only managed to prove 1 out of 100 items of damage and could only recover 1% of its original claim 
- Held: Defendant was successful party in the action and was awarded 85% of his costs 
1. Plaintiff only manage to prove 1 out of the 100 items of damage that had been listed in its statement of claim 
2. Plaintiff would only be able to recover 1% of its original claim 
3. Defendants were thus the winning party in respect of the plaintiff’s claim against them  

*Step 2: Court may depart from the starting point in certain circumstances 
Court may disallow or reduce successful party’s entitlement to costs because of successful party’s poor conduct 
O 21 r 4
- The Court may disallow or reduce a successful party’s costs or order that party to pay costs, if:
a. Successful party unnecessarily increased amount of time, costs or complexity of proceedings: That party has failed to establish any claim or issue which that party has raised in any proceedings, thereby unnecessarily increasing the amount of time taken, the costs or the complexity of the proceedings;
b. Successful party did or omitted to do something unreasonably: That party has done or omitted to do anything unreasonably;
c. Successful party did not discharge duty to consider amicable resolution: That party has not discharged that party’s duty to consider amicable resolution of the dispute or to make an offer of amicable resolution in accordance with Order 5; or
=> Para 53 of Supreme Court PD: Solicitors duty to advise their clients on potential adverse costs for any unreasonable refusal to engage in ADR 
d. Successful party failed to comply with order of court or PD: That party has failed to comply with any order of court, any relevant pre?action protocol or any practice direction.

Case Law – Principles 
Principle 1: Costs should follow the event unless it appears to the Court that some other order should be made (Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrew G) 

Principle 2: Costs should follow the event even if the successful party had raised issues or makes allegations on which he fails => Court should only deprive successful party of costs if he has caused a significant increase in length or costs of proceedings (Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrew G)

Principle 3: Where successful party raises issues or makes improper or unreasonable allegations => Court may deprive successful party’s entitlement to costs and even order him to pay the unsuccessful party’s costs 
(Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrew G)

E.g. Successful party unnecessarily increasing complexity of proceedings 
Raffles Town Club v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others, third parties) 
- Rule: Court will consider whether successful party: 
a. Put forward and argued at length plainly unsustainable, unmeritorious or unreasonable issues 
b. Presented a false case or false evidence 
- Held: Peter was successful party but was deprived of PnP costs
1. There were significant evidence establishing that Peter Lim was a de facto director and beneficial shareholder of RTC => Peter Lim still denied
2. Peter also unnecessarily protracted and added to the complexity of the proceedings by concealing his beneficial shareholding of 40% in RTC and the very substantial payments of money and distribution of other benefits arising out of that large beneficial shareholding 

E.g. Successful party should not be deprived of its costs even though it failed on one ground 
MCST No. 473 v De Beers Jewelry Pte Ltd 
- Held: Successful party had failed on one ground, but it should not be deprived of its cost  
1. Trial had ended within allocated time 
2. Successful party relied on the same facts for the failed ground and successful ground and unsuccessful party relied on the same defenses for both grounds => There was no significant increase in cost of proceedings 

*Court can make adverse costs orders against solicitor in certain scenarios 
If solicitor incurs costs unreasonably in the proceedings => Court may make certain orders 
O 21 r 6(1)
- If the solicitor is responsible, either personally or through an employee or agent, for incurring costs unreasonably in the proceedings, the Court may:
a. Disallow S&C costs in whole or in part: Disallow the costs as between the solicitor and his or her client in whole or in part;
b. Order solicitor to reimburse P&P costs paid by client: Order the solicitor to repay to his or her client costs which the client has been ordered to pay in the proceedings; and
c. Order solicitor to indemnify any other party: Order the solicitor to indemnify any other party in the proceedings for costs payable by them.

Court must give solicitor a reasonable opportunity to be heard before ordering adverse costs orders against them 
O 21 r 6(2)
- Before the Court makes an order under paragraph (1), the Court must give the solicitor a reasonable opportunity to be heard, either by way of an oral hearing or by written submissions.

3-step test to determine if costs should be ordered against solicitors personally 
Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v AG and anor matter [2022] SGCA 44
- 3-step test to determine if costs should be ordered against solicitors personally: 
1. Has the solicitor acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently?
2. Did such conduct cause the applicant to incur unnecessary costs?
3. Is it in all the circumstances just to order the solicitors to compensate the applicant for the whole or any part of the relevant costs? 

- Held: Personal costs orders sought against both Mr Ravi and Ms Netto
1. The arguments advanced had factual weaknesses and problems which would have been apparent to any reasonable defense counsel 
2. Both solicitors drip-fed supposed evidence and arguments and their conduct amounted to blatant and egregious abuse of the court’s processes 
3. AGC had incurred unnecessary costs 

Note:
- O 21 r 6(3): The Court may direct that notice be given to the solicitor’s client concerning any proceedings or order against the solicitor under this Rule.
- O 21 r 6(4): The Court may, if the Court thinks fit, direct or authorise the Attorney?General to attend and take part in any proceedings or inquiry under this Rule, and may make such order as the Court thinks fit as to the payment of the Attorney?General’s costs

Court can make adverse costs orders against non-party in certain scenarios
O 21 r 5(1)
- Where it is just to do so, the Court may order costs against a non?party if the non?party has:
a. Scenario 1: Non-party assigned rights in action to a party in return for a share of any money which party may recover in the action: Assigned the non?party’s right in the action to a party in return for a share of any money or property which that party may recover in the action;
b. Scenario 2: Non-party contributed to a party’s legal cost in return for a share of money recovered in action: Contributed or agreed to contribute to a party’s costs in return for a share of any money or property which that party may recover in the action; or
c. Scenario 3: Non-party contributed to party’s legal costs and instigated party to continue with action: Contributed or agreed to contribute to a party’s costs and actively instigates or encourages that party to continue with the action.

Court must give non-party a reasonable opportunity to be heard before ordering adverse costs orders against them 
O 21 r 5(2)
- Before the Court makes an order under paragraph (1), the Court must give the non?party a reasonable opportunity to be heard, either by way of an oral hearing or by written submissions.

In multi-party actions, Court can order 2 parties’ costs to be set off against each other
- E.g. Claimant commences against 2 defendants but succeeds only against one and loses to another => Court can make: 
a. Bullock Order: Claimant ordered to pay winning defendant costs, but claimant is permitted to recover those costs together with his own costs from losing defendant  
b. Sanderson order:  Claimant and winning defendant both recover costs directly from losing defendant 

O 21 r 2(5)
- The Court may order 2 or more parties’ costs to be set off against one another so that only the balance has to be paid

Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd 
- Bullock Order: Claimant ordered to pay winning defendant costs but claimant is permitted to recover those costs together with his own costs from losing defendant  
- Sanderson order:  Claimant and winning defendant both recover costs directly from losing defendant 
- Purpose: 
* Avoid injustice befalling to a claimant who reasonably did not know whom to pursue for the wrong done to him 
- Factors considered by Court:
a. Whether costs had been reasonably and properly incurred by the claimant between himself and the winning defendant => Whether the conduct of the unsuccessful defendant contributed to these costs being incurred by the claimant => Whether it would be unjust on an unsuccessful defendant to make him liable for the costs of another defendant against whom the claimant had failed 
b. Where claimant’s claim against two defendants are distinct and separate causes of action => No Bullock Order or Sanderson Order 

After party’s percentage entitlement to costs has been established
1. Whether costs are to be fixed or assessed
2. Where costs are to be assessed, whether this is done on a standard or indemnity basis 
3. When should costs be paid
4. Consequences for non-payment

Step 3: After determining each party’s percentage entitlement to costs, Court will assess whether the quantum of costs should be fixed or assessed 
Default is fixed unless Court thinks fit to direct assessment
O 21 r 2(3) 
- Subject to the provisions of this Order and any written law, the costs payable by any party to any other party in any matter must be fixed by the Court which heard the matter after an oral hearing or by way of written submissions from the parties, unless the Court thinks fit to direct an assessment of the costs

Step 4A: Where costs are fixed, how should it be done?

Note: 
- Costs orders should be sought at the end of interlocutory stage or end of proceedings from the same court 
- Costs orders cannot be an independent cause of action if it is consequential on the results of another previous proceeding

(ii) If the contested summons is complex and the upper end of the costs range set out in Part IIB is lower than the upper end of the costs range set out in Part IIA, reference may be made to the Part IIA costs range

Part 2: Court will conduct oral hearing or by way of written submissions 
O 21 r 2(3)
- Court hears parties by oral hearing or by way of written submissions 

Practically: 
- Court will start from the Costs Schedules filed by parties and make adjustments after hearing from parties whether costs orders should tend to the upper or lower limit of the range 

Step 4B: Where costs are assessed, how should it be done? 
Part 1: Court must determine if assessment of costs should be done on a standard basis or indemnity basis 
Costs assessed on standard basis – All costs not allowed unless they are reasonable
O 21 r 22(2)
- Assessment of costs on standard basis:
* Costs are a reasonable amount in respect of all costs reasonably incurred; and
* Any doubts which the Registrar may have as to whether the costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount are to be resolved in favor of the paying party

Costs assessed on indemnity basis – All costs allowed unless they are unreasonable 
O 21 r 22(3) 
- Assessment of costs on indemnity basis: 
* Costs are all costs except insofar as they are of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred; and 
* Any doubts which the Registrar may have as to whether the costs were reasonably incurred or were reasonable in amount are to be resolved in favor of the receiving party  

Part 2: The default position is assessment on a standard basis 
O 21 r 22(1)
- Subject to the other provisions of these Rules, the amount of costs which any party is entitled to recover is the amount allowed after assessment on the standard basis where:
a. An order is made that the costs of one party to the proceedings be paid by another party to those proceedings;
b. An order is made for the payment of costs out of any fund; or
c. No order for costs is required,
unless it appears to the Court to be appropriate to order costs to be assessed on the indemnity basis.

O 21 r 22(4)
- Where the Court makes an order for assessment of costs without indicating the basis of assessment or on any basis other than the standard basis or the indemnity basis, the costs are to be assessed on the standard basis

Part 3: Court will depart from default position and order assessment on an indemnity basis if party’s conduct is poor 
Indemnity basis ordered if party’s conduct evinced dishonesty, impropriety or abuse of judicial process
Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others, third parties) 
- Rule: Indemnity basis will be ordered where party’s conduct evinced such a degree of dishonesty, impropriety or abuse of judicial process to warrant a departure from the usual basis of costs
- Held: Standard basis was ordered
1. Even though RTC’s conduct merited criticism as they relied on claims inconsistent with positions previously taken, relied on documents which were inadmissible in law and adopted tactics that caused embarrassment to Peter Lim => RTC’s conduct did not reach the threshold for indemnity basis to be ordered

Tjong Very Sumio v Antia Investments Pte Ltd 
- Held: Indemnity costs was ordered
1. Party deliberately ignored an arbitration or a jurisdiction clause to derive from its own breach of contract an unjustifiable procedural advantage 
2. Party’s act constitutes a breach of contract and a misuse of judicial facilities offered by English courts or a foreign court 

Situations where Court will order assessment on an indemnity basis

- Court would order assessment on indemnity basis against a litigant who: 
a. Bring case with ulterior or improper motive: Brings his case with an ulterior motive or for an improper purpose
b. Conduct case in bad faith or as personal vendetta: Conducts his cases in bad faith or as a personal vendetta
c. Conduct case in improper or oppressive manner: Conducts their case in an improper or oppressive manner
d. Caused costs to be incurred irrationally: Causes costs to be incurred irrationally or out of all proportion as to what is at stake

h. Aggressively pursues allegations despite lack of documentary evidence: Advances and aggressively pursues such allegations, despite the lack of any foundation in the documentary evidence for those allegations, and maintains the allegations, without apology, to the bitter end;
i. Actively seeks to court publicity for its serious allegations both before and during the trial in the international, and national and local media;
j. By its conduct, turns a case into an unprecedented factual enquiry by the pursuit of an unjustified case;
k. Pursues a claim which is, to put it most charitably, thin and, in some respects, far-fetched;
l. Pursues a claim which is irreconcilable with the contemporaneous documents;
m. Commences and pursues large-scale and expensive litigation in circumstances calculated to exert commercial pressure on a defendant, and during the course of the trial of the action, the claimant resorts to advancing a constantly changing case in order to justify the allegations which it has made, only then to suffer a resounding defeat.
- Held: Standard basis was ordered 
1. Even though plaintiff’s case was thin and ultimately irreconcilable with contemporaneous documents and the law + plaintiff’s case was merely an afterthought which was dispatched quickly during cross-examination 
2. However, plaintiff’s conduct did not reach the threshold for indemnity basis to be ordered: 
a. Plaintiff had no ulterior motive in bringing proceedings and it was a good faith attempt to secure compensation to which he genuinely thought he was entitled
b. Plaintiff had not conducted his case in an oppressive or unreasonable manner or caused costs to be incurred irrationally or disproportionately 
c. Plaintiff’s lawyer did not protract cross-examination of defendant’s witness by pursuing hopeless aspects of the plaintiff’s case or side issues of marginal relevance 
d. Cross-examination of four defense witnesses were done efficiently in a little over a day 

Part 4: Ultimately, Court will also consider the relevant circumstances in O 21 r 2(2) when assessing costs 
O 21 r 2(2) 
- In exercising its power to fix or assess costs, the Court must have regard to all relevant circumstances, including:
a. Efforts to reach amicable resolution: Efforts made by the parties at amicable resolution;

Costs are payable from date of Court’s costs order
O 21 r 2(4) 
- The costs in any matter are payable from the date of the Court’s order unless the parties otherwise agree

Note:
- In practice: Parties might agree to defer payment of costs especially when the case is on appeal and there is a chance that the costs order would be substantially different based on the outcome of the appeal 

Step 6: What are consequences for non-payment?
If party refuses to pay costs from previous proceedings => Court can prevent party from commencing or continuing new proceedings 
O 21 r 2(6)
- If party refuses or refuses or neglects to pay any costs ordered within the specified time, whether the costs were ordered in the present proceedings or in some related proceedings => The Court may stay or dismiss any application, action or appeal or make any other order as the Court deems fit 

If party refuses to pay costs => Costs will carry interests at 5.33% per year from the date mentioned in second column 
O 21 r 29(1)
- The costs mentioned in the first column of the following table carry interest at 5.33% per year from the date mentioned in the second column of the table until payment:

Instructions for bundle of authorities 
Para 105(1) of Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 
- Bundle of authorities must comply with the requirements under paragraph 101(5) to (11) of these Practice Directions

Step 6: After assessment hearing and Registrar has decided on the amount of costs payable by Respondent to Applicant => Applicant must apply for certificate and enforcement order 
After assessment hearing and Registrar has decided, Applicant must apply for certificate
O 21 r 25
- When the bill of costs has been assessed, the solicitor must apply for the certificate of the Registrar for the amount of costs allowed by the Registrar.

After obtaining certificate, Applicant can apply for enforcement order within 48 hours if no application for review
O 21 r 26
- Upon the assessment of the bill of costs, the certificate of the Registrar, unless set aside, is conclusive as to the amount of costs allowed, and, where the order contains a submission to pay, the solicitor may after 48 hours, if there is no application for review, apply for an enforcement order to be issued in respect of the costs allowed

Step 7: Dissatisfied party can apply for review 
O 21 r 27
(1) Dissatisfied party can apply to Judge to review assessment decision: Any party to any assessment proceedings who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Registrar in respect of any item may apply to a Judge to review the assessment as to that item or part of an item, as the case may be.
(2) Dissatisfied party must make application for review within 14 days after assessment decision: An application under this Rule for review of the Registrar’s decision may be made at any time within 14 days after that decision.
(3) Application for review must be made by summons and heard in chambers: An application under this Rule must be made by summons and must be heard in chambers, unless the Judge otherwise orders.
(4) Application for review does not prejudice power of Registrar to issue an interim certificate for items not under review: An application under this Rule for review of the Registrar’s decision in respect of any item does not prejudice the power of the Registrar under Rule 14 to issue an interim certificate in respect of the items of the Registrar’s decision which are not the subject of the review.
(5) Definition of Judge – DJ, GDHC, ADHC, CA: In this Rule and Rule 28, “Judge” means a Judge sitting in the General Division or a District Judge and includes a judge sitting in the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeal where appropriate.

O 21 r 28 
(1) Parties cannot produce further evidence on review unless Judge directs so: Unless the Judge otherwise directs, no further evidence may be received on the hearing of the review of the Registrar’s decision by the Judge, but except as mentioned, on the hearing of the review, the Judge may exercise all such powers and discretion as are vested in the Registrar in relation to the subject matter of the application.
(2) Judge on review can order amendment of Registrar’s certificate or can remit matter back to Registrar for assessment (remission only allowed if the item under review is not as to amount): At the conclusion of the review, the Judge may make such order as the circumstances require, and in particular may order the Registrar’s certificate to be amended or (except where the dispute as to the item under review is as to amount only) order the item to be remitted to the Registrar for assessment.

Judge on review is hearing matter de novo
Judge on review is not fettered by Registrar’s decision even though he ought to give appropriate weightage to the Registrar’s decision 
Shorvon Simon v Singapore Medical Council 
- When judge on review hears matter de novo, he is not fettered by the discretion exercised by the Registrar and may substitute his discretion for that of the Registrar although he ought to give appropriate weightage to the Registrar’s decision on the quantum allowed
- Different from an appellate Court hearing the matter as an appellate Court would be reluctant to interfere with a lower Court’s exercise of discretion unless the decision was manifestly wrong or exercised on wrong principles 

Step 8: Dissatisfied party can also appeal 
Note:
- Dissatisfied party can either appeal costs order without review or apply for review then appeal decision on review 





Preparation of Bill of Costs 
Context
- Bill of Costs can be used in assessment hearings for S&C costs and P&P costs 
- For P&P costs: When Court orders assessment of costs, parties will have to attend a taxation hearing at a later date for Court to assess amount of P&P costs payable
- At taxation hearing, the receiving party will submit a Bill of Costs to decide the quantum of P&P costs payable by the paying party 
- Bill of Costs includes fees, charges, expenses and remuneration for: 
1. Work done in civil case
2. Work done for and in the taxation of costs
3. All disbursements made in the civil case

Bill of Costs has 3 sections 
1. Section 1 costs: Costs of main proceedings
2. Section 2 costs: Costs of assessment proceedings 
3. Section 3 costs: Disbursements 

Section 1 Costs
O 21 r 20(1)(a) 
- Work done in the cause or matter, except for assessment of costs

Court’s consideration of Section 1 Costs
O 21 r 2(2) 
- In exercising its power to fix or assess costs, the Court must have regard to all relevant circumstances, including:
i. Efforts to reach amicable resolution: Efforts made by the parties at amicable resolution;
j. Complexity of case and novelty of questions: The complexity of the case and the difficulty or novelty of the questions involved;
k. Skill, specialized knowledge, time labor expended by solicitor: The skill, specialised knowledge and responsibility required of, and the time and labour expended by, the solicitor
l. Urgency and importance of action to parties: The urgency and importance of the action to the parties;
m. Number of solicitors involved: The number of solicitors involved in the case for each party;
n. Parties’ conduct: The conduct of the parties;
o. Proportionality: The principle of proportionality; and
p. Stage which proceedings conclude: The stage at which the proceedings were concluded

Principle of proportionality and Framework 
Lin Jian Wei v Lim Eng Hock Peter
- When quantifying costs, Court has to consider:
a. Principle of proportionality: Costs should be proportionate to the amount or value at stake 
b. Framework: 
(i) Assess relative complexity of the matter and the work supposedly done against what was reasonably required in the prevailing circumstances, the reasonableness and proportionality of the amounts claimed on an item by item basis
(ii) Assess proportionality of the resulting aggregate costs
(iii) Consider costs guidelines 
(iv) No single consideration should ordinarily take precedence 

Section 2 Costs 
O 21 r 20(1)(b)
- Work done for and in the assessment of costs

Court’s consideration of Section 2 Costs
O 21 r 13
(1) Party entitled to costs of main proceedings also entitled to costs of assessment proceedings: Subject to the provisions of any written law, the party whose bill is being assessed is entitled to the party’s costs of the assessment proceedings.
(2) Party liable for cost may make written offer to settle costs of assessment proceedings any time 14 days after BC is delivered: The party liable to pay the costs of the proceedings which gave rise to the assessment proceedings may make a written offer to pay a specific sum in satisfaction of those costs which is expressed to be “without prejudice except as to the costs of the assessment of costs”, at any time before the expiration of 14 days after the delivery to the party of a copy of the bill of costs under Rule 19 and, where such an offer is made, the fact that it has been made must not be communicated to the Registrar until the question of the costs of the assessment proceedings falls to be decided.
(3) Registrar can consider written offer when assessing costs of assessment proceedings: The Registrar may take into account any offer made under paragraph (2) which has been brought to the Registrar’s attention.

Note:
- In practice: BC respondent can make an offer to settle costs of assessment proceedings with BC applicant and mark the offer as “without prejudice except as to the costs of the assessment of costs” => Means that the offer would not be shown to the Registrar contemporaneously => If the offer is accepted then there will be no issue on the costs of assessment hearing => If the offer is not accepted, Registrar assessing the costs of assessment hearing can consider the offer which was given by the BC respondent => If Registrar takes the view that the BC applicant should have accepted the offer and done away with the need for assessment hearing => Registrar can reduce the amount of costs of assessment hearing which the BC applicant is entitled to 

Section 3 Costs
O 21 r 20(1)(c)
- All disbursements made in the cause or matter

Scope of disbursements claimable
Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa 
- General rule: Disbursements claimed should be expenses that have been paid 
- Disbursements include: 
a. Actual expenses paid out 
b. Loans or debts incurred by a party for the purpose of litigation provided that it was proven that the loans or debts were due and payable after taxation 
- Evidence such as invoices or bills must be tendered to prove disbursements 

S&C costs (information only) 
- S&C costs can be based on agreement between solicitor and client => If either solicitor or client dissatisfied, can apply for taxation: judicial process to determine reasonableness of legal fee => Taxation has two basis i.e. standard basis and indemnity basis 
- Solicitor can tax his own bills of costs if client disputes the quantum => Solicitor can only present bill for taxation one month from delivery of bill => After bills of cost is taxed, solicitor can sue client on the taxed costs 

S&C costs based on agreement between solicitor and client 
S111 of LPA 
(1) Agreement either by a gross sum or otherwise and at any rate: Subject to the provisions of any other written law, a solicitor or law corporation or limited liability law partnership may make an agreement in writing with any client respecting the amount and manner of payment for the whole or any part of his, her or its costs in respect of contentious business done or to be done by the solicitor or law corporation or limited liability law partnership, either by a gross sum or otherwise, and at either the same rate as or a greater or a lesser rate than that at which the solicitor or the law corporation or limited liability law partnership would otherwise be entitled to be remunerated.

FAQ:
- Do not need to know form number and contents; just where to find them
- S 17(c) of the SCJA is under “original jurisdiction powers” as it relates to Registrar’s appeals --> these are NOT the exercise of appellate powers by the HC. 
o Some interlocutory applications are heard at first instance by a registrar and not judge, and it is possible to file appeal to a judge. 
o BUT both registrar and judge are exercising HC jurisdiction (and not appellate jurisdiction), so it is de novo jurisdiction (same tier of court)
o See s 20 SJCA for appellate jurisdiction of HC
- How do you know if Df can pay?
o Df may have no assets that you can enforce against; qn is should Pf have commenced proceedings from a commercial POV, even though they had a good case. Have to hire investigators and bear in mind commercial considerations of cost.
