1. Introduction to competition law
* Objective of competition law is to correct market failure caused by anti-competitive behaviour
o Assumption that competitive markets will lead to good outcomes
o In the absence of competition law, elimination of competitors is the best way to increase profits
o To protect the process of competition in Singapore and to correct market failure caused by anti-competitive behaviour, which might disadvantage consumers and also other competitors and potential market entrants

* Over 125 jurisdictions worldwide have competition law regimes

* Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (“CCCS”) administers the competition regime in Singapore.
o The CCCS is a statutory board of MTI
o As of May 2023, more than 750 publicly recorded cases, of which CCCS issued 19 infringement decisions and imposed financial penalties of close to S$80 million. No jail terms yet for anti-competitive conduct
o CCCS Investigations by default confidential; Only cases which result in proposed infringement decision will be made public. Cases which are successfully defended will remain confidential.

* Distinguished from 
o Unfair competition laws: strive to achieve economic equity.
o Consumer rights law: focus on consumer, but in competition law focus is on competitive process
* Note: CCCS has now also taken on the function of consumer protection under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act Behaviour prohibitions (Antitrust)

* SCOPE: Competition Act applies broadly to any persons (“undertakings”) regardless of whether foreign- or Singapore-owned, and includes companies owned by the Singapore government – as long as they are engaged in commercial or economic activity
o “undertakings” meaning any person, being an individual, a body corporate, an incorporated body of persons or any other entity capable of commercial and economic activity, regardless of 
o whether they are foreign- or Singapore-owned

* Policy objectives
o Consumer welfare approach (EC focuses on this) --> considers the transfer from consumer surplus to producer surplus to be harmful
o **Total welfare approach: Sum of producer and consumer surplus (Singapore focuses on this) --> total welfare may be maximised by a transfer from consumer surplus to producer surplus, if the overall value generated by the economy increases. This approach recognises that while increased prices in the short term may lower consumer demand, such prices will self-correct when new entrants in the absence of artificial exclusionary barriers enter the market to claim the difference between monopoly prices and cost of goods

o Public interest approach

* Prohibitions regime
o Behavioural prohibitions – regulate market behaviour
* Anti-competitive agreements (Part III, Division 2, s34 CA)
* Abuse of dominant position (Part III, Division 3, s47 CA)

o Structural prohibitions – regulates changes to market structures which may substantially lessen competition
* Merger control “substantial lessening of competition” (Part II, Division 4, s54 CA)


2. *Anti-competitive agreements (s34 CA) [MARKET BEHAVIOUR PROHIBITION / ANTITRUST]

Prohibition: 
(1) Agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices which have as their 
(2) object (intent) OR effect, the 
(3) prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within Singapore are prohibited unless an exemption applies (s34(1) CA)

Preliminary step: market definition (CCCS Guidelines on Market Definition para 1.2) (See below)

Element 1: Agreements or concerted practice
* Extremely low formality requirements: Meeting of minds on the actions that each party will or will not take in the market
o Does not need to have a legally enforceable agreement. Can even be “gentlemen’s agreements”, or any written or oral agreement (Guidelines on s34 [2.10])
o Conscious parallelism: Firms may after a period of time become aware of each other’s repeated actions and without an express agreement coordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour.
* Same economic effect as an agreement to distort the market
o It does not matter that the agreement was entered into outside Singapore, or that a party is outside Singapore (s33(1) CA)

* TEST: A concerted practice is defined as *knowingly substituting the risks of competition for practical cooperation between undertakings (Infringement of the section 34 prohibition in relation to the sale and distribution of fresh chicken products in Singapore CCCS 500/7002/14 (“Fresh Chicken”), [97]); It has 3 elements: 
1) Intentional communication or contact,
2) Conduct on the market (note: not anti-competitive effect), and 
3) Causal link between communication/contact and conduct (defined in Tesco v OFT (in the UK) and in Anic (in the EU), cited approvingly in Fresh Chicken [100])

* “A concerted practice would be found to exist if parties, even if they did not enter into an agreement, knowingly substituted the risks of competition with co-operation between them.” (Guidelines on s34 [2.18])

* E.g. Information sharing: Presumption of concerted practice: Anic presumption: There is a presumption that market actors use information exchanged with their competitors when determining their conduct on that market (i.e. concerted practice) (Fresh Chicken, [100], citing Anic approvingly) 
o Following one-way provision of exchange (Ferry Operators, [120])
* E.g. “**Even a one-way provision of information by Batam Fast or mere receipt by Penguin, without any reciprocal exchange raised the presumption that Penguin’s future behaviour on the market would not be independent” in Ferry Operators, [120]) 
* Rationale: “Such flow of information would have increased the transparency on the duopoly market at the material time where there was already limited opportunity for competition and thus made it easier for competitors to act in concert.” (Ferry Operators Engaging in Unlawful Sharing of Price Information CCS 500/006/09, [120])

* E.g. Mere participation in meeting: “…the mere participation by an undertaking in a meeting with an anti-competitive purpose, without expressing manifest opposition to or publicly distancing itself from, the same is tantamount to a tacit approval of that unlawful initiative” (Price fixing of monthly salaries of new Indonesian Foreign Domestic Workers by Employment Agencies CCS 500/001/11, [52])

Single economic unit exclusion
* *s34 prohibition does not apply to agreements between entities which form a single economic unit (Paras 2.7 and 2.8 of CCCS Guidelines on s34). s34 prohibitions does not apply to agreements between: 
o A parent and its subsidiary company
o 2 subsidiary companies, both under the control of a common parent company
o CCCS will consider the following factors to decide if a subsidiary is part of the same economic unit as its parent: 
* Parent’s shareholding in subsidiary
* Parent’s control of the subsidiary’s board of directors
* Whether subsidiary complies with directions of the parent on sales, marketing activities and investment matters

Element 2: Object OR effect: Infringing as long as there is either an intent or effect
* Disjunctive: Agreements can be infringing even if there’s no object or intent, as long as there is an effect, and vice versa. After object is proven, no need go further to prove effect (Guidelines on s34 [2.22])

* Object restrictions are also known as per se violations
o E.g. “the exchange and provision of sensitive and confidential price information between Batam Fast and Penguin in relation to the sale of ferry tickets to various destinations in Batam to corporate clients and travel agents had the object of preventing, restricting or distorting competition to an appreciable extent” in Ferry Operators, [163]
o Factors for assessing whether object restriction: agreement content, objective aims pursued by arrangement, context in which the agreement is (to be) applied, actual conduct and behaviour of parties on relevant market(s) (Guidelines on s 34 [2.23])

* Agreements that are not per se violations (i.e. no object or intent) but may have anticompetitive effects: must examine facts and circumstances to determine effect

Element 3: Prevention, restriction or distortion of competition
Types of agreement which have the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition within Singapore and infringe s34 if they (s34(2) CA):
a. Rate-fixing: directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;
b. Output limiting: limit or control production, markets, technical development or investment;
c. Market sharing: share markets or sources of supply;
d. Discrimination: apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; or
e. Something like bundling: make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.

* Tier 1 violations / essentially per se violations (para 3.2 CCCS Guidelines on s34)
a. price-fixing (price stability, price ceilings or floors), 
* Examples of price agreements: Agreements to adhere to published price lists and agreements to fix a price or a component of a price (para 3.4 CCCS Guidelines on s34)
* E.g. price-fixing by determining the quantum and timing of price movements in relation to the sale and distribution of fresh chickens, “Price Discussions” in Fresh Chicken

b. bid-rigging (collusive tendering), 
* Where two undertakings collaborate on responses to a tender e.g. by agreeing to allocate bids between themselves or agreeing on the lowest offer to be submitted

c. market sharing (e.g. agreements to divide a product or geographical market), and 
* E.g. market-sharing by not competing for each other’s customers, “Non-Aggression Pact” (NAP) in Fresh Chicken
1) E.g. “CCCS has taken the following indicia together as supporting evidence that the NAP was implemented, and that the Parties had participated in the NAP:
a. statements by Chiew, Ong, Ng, Alex Toh, and Quek Cheaw Kwang (“Quek”) from Prestige Fortune; 
b. statements by employees that it is industry practice to focus on their own customers and not accost customers belonging to other distributors; 
c. statements from customers stating that fresh chicken distributors do not approach them to encourage switching, or that it was difficult to switch distributors; 
d. specific incidents involving refusals to compete as recounted; 
e. statements by employees confirming a policy not to compete for customers; and
f. enforcement of the NAP through informal sanctions by the Parties.” (Fresh Chicken (SGCAB), [114])
2) C.f appellant A2; “It is not uncommon for some business practices not to poach or steal clients of another not because of any anti-competitive arrangements, but more because of their personal, close or familial relationships.” In Fresh Chicken (SGCAB), [128]
3) C.f. appellant A3; statement that fresh chicken distributors agreed that “it is better to have no competition” because competition then was “very fierce” could not be interpreted to mean participation in the NAP and appellant had also been “actively competing in the market” in Fresh Chicken (SGCAB), [140], [142]
4) C.f. appellant A5 except for subsidiary Prestige Fortune; “putting the statements relied on by CCCS in the ID in the context of all the answers he gave in his NOIs [Notes of Information]” CAB disagreed that the Sales Manager from A5 had stated that “it is industry practice to focus on their own customers and not accost customers belonging to other distributors” in Fresh Chicken (SGCAB), [156]
5) C.f. appellant A6; same reasoning as for A2 in Fresh Chicken (SGCAB), [166]

d. output limiting agreements (e.g. production quotas)

* Tier 2 violations (para 3.2 CCCS Guidelines on s34) – agreements which do NOT distort competition per se, but may infringe s34 depending on the circumstances: 
a. Standardisation agreements and standard terms and conditions (including technical or design standards)
o May prevent parties from developing alternative products that don’t comply with agreed standards
o Common sense required – sometimes standardization is for a good reason such as safety (e.g. elevator parts). Intention and effect in such cases is not to distort competition

b. Joint purchasing or selling, 
o E.g. an agreement between buyers to fix the price they’re going to quote to sellers, or an agreement to boycott certain identified suppliers
o E.g. Express Bus Agencies Association case 3 November 2009 (CCS 500/003/008)
* CCS found that coach operators with their trade association, the EBAA, distorted competition on the prices of coach tickets between Singapore and destinations in Malaysia for a period of 3 years. 
* The operators agreed to fix prices by procuring the setting of minimum selling prices and imposing fuel and insurance chargers on passengers (which were marked up by >300%).
* Overall, the ticket price of a one-way express ticket from Singapore to KL increased by 61% from 2003 to 2008

c. Information sharing, (Note moving closer to a tier 1 violation after Fresh Chickens and Ferry Operators) 
o Exchange of public information may be pro-competitive
o BUT information sharing which seeks to reduce or remove uncertainties inherent in the process of competition could be anti-competitive (e.g. sensitive and confidential non-public information like pricing policies, capacity levels, output and marketing plans) (Guidelines on s34 [3.20])
o Generally, “it is more likely that there would be an appreciable adverse effect on competition the smaller the number of undertakings operating in the market, the simpler and more transparent the market, the more stable the market, the more frequent the exchange, the more sensitive and confidential the nature of the information which is exchanged, and where information exchanged is limited to certain participating undertakings to the exclusion of their competitors and buyers.” (Guidelines on s34 [3.20])
o Unilateral disclosure of information may constitute concerted practice if it was requested or accepted (Guidelines on s34 [3.21])

d. Restrictive advertising

Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition Test
* An agreement falls within s34 “if it has as its object or effect the appreciable prevention, restriction or distortion of competition” (Guidelines on s34 [2.21])
* Guidelines on s34 [2.25]: Generally no appreciable adverse effect on competition if:
a. Aggregate market shares of competing parties to the agreement doesn’t exceed 20%,
b. Market share of each of the non-competing parties does not exceed 25%, or
c. Each undertaking is an SME

Grounds of exclusion for s34 prohibition found in the Third Schedule of CA
s34 prohibition does not apply to matters specified in the Third Schedule (s35 CA):
1. Undertakings entrusted with operation of services of general economic interest 
2. Agreements to comply with another legal requirement in Singapore 
3. Agreements to avoid conflict with international obligations: Any agreement which Minister has excluded from s34 prohibition in order to avoid a conflict with an international obligation of Singapore 
4. Agreement excluded for reasons of public policy: Any agreement which Minister has excluded from s34 prohibition for compelling reasons of public policy  
5. Agreement relating to goods and services regulated by other competition law 
6. Specified activities
7. Agreements relating to Clearing Houses 

8. *Vertical agreements: Agreement entered into between 2 undertakings which operate at different levels of the production or distribution chain (e.g. agreement between manufacturer and distributer)
o Note – this refers to relationships such as manufacturer-distributor-retailer. However, the key is the NATURE of the agreement, rather than the relationship between the parties to the agreement
o Example: hub-and-spoke practices
o Common misunderstanding is that anything that is not a horizontal agreement (i.e. only players who are making the same product) is under this vertical agreement exclusion. But that’s not the case. Non-horizontal agreement does not mean an excluded vertical agreement (para 2.13, CCCS Guidelines on s34) --> i.e. just because it is not horizontal, does not mean it is excluded as a vertical agreement
o There are such things as diagonal agreements, e.g. buy car and finance with this bank, get better interest rates. These could possibly (but not always) be considered anti-competitive, and more likely might fall under abuse of dominant position. 
o Example of agreement that is in breach – standardization agreement: a certain large proportion of milk powder manufacturers agree to include some supplements in their formula and markup for it. Can be quite subtle, e.g. minimum spec standard for laptops 

9. *Agreements with net economic benefit: Any agreement which has net economic benefit
o If agreement “contributes to improving production or distribution or promoting technical or economic progress” and the restrictions are “indispensable to the attainment of those objectives”, they are excluded from s34 (by virtue of s35) (Guidelines on s34 [2.29])

10. Agreements directly related and necessary to implementation of mergers
11. Mergers

Managing the risk of infringing s 34
* Leniency Applications 
o CCCS provides incentives to whistle blow – first firm to whistle blow can receive full immunity from financial penalties. Subsequent whistle blowers may qualify for lower levels of financial penalty at the CCCS’s discretion

* Block exemption (s36(4) CA)
o MTI may make such an order on CCCS’s recommendation if there are net economic benefits 
o s36 block exemption applies to any agreement which contributes to (s41 CA): 
a. Improving production or distribution; OR 
b. Promoting technical or economic progress,
but which does not:
c. Impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of those objectives; OR 
d. Afford the undertakings concerned the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the goods or services in question.

* Notification to CCCS for guidance (s42 CA) or decision (s44 CA)
o Firms may wish to notify an agreement to CCCS where there is uncertainty concerning its enforceability
o Decisions following notification will be made public, whereas guidances of the CCCS will generally not be

Consequences of Infringement
* Infringer has opportunity to make representations to CCCS, where it proposes to make a decision that the agreement infringes s34 (s68 CA)
* Agreements are void and unenforceable (Guidelines on s34 [7.1])
* Financial penalty: MR is required - must be intentional or negligent infringement of s34. Penalty “not exceeding 10% of the turnover of the business of an undertaking in Singapore for each year of infringement may be imposed for a maximum period of three (3) years” (Guidelines on s34 [7.2])
* Right of private action by any party who has suffered any loss or damage directly as a result of infringement of s34, after CCCS has determined that an undertaking has infringed s34 and after appeal process has been exhausted (Guidelines on s34 [7.3]-[7.4])

Appeal process
* s71-72 CA: Party can appeal against CCCS decision to Competition Appeal Board (CAB)
* s74 CA: Party can appeal against Competition Appeal Board’s decision to the General Division of the High Court but only on:
o On a point of law arising from CAB’s decision 
o On CAB’s decision on quantum of financial penalty

3. *Abuse of dominant position (unilateral conduct) (s47 CA) [MARKET BEHAVIOUR PROHIBITION / ANTITRUST]

Prohibition: “any conduct on the part of one or more undertakings which amounts to the abuse of a dominant position in any market in Singapore is prohibited.” (s 47(1) CA)

s47(2) CA: “conduct may, in particular, constitute such an abuse if it consists in —
(a) predatory behaviour towards competitors;
(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;
(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; or
(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of the contracts.”

s47(3) CA: “dominant position” means a dominant position within Singapore or elsewhere – i.e. it does not matter that the undertaking is outside Singapore, as long as its abuse of dominant position has effect in Singapore.

3-step test:
1. What is the relevant market?
2. Is there a dominant position in the relevant market?
3. Has there been abuse of the dominant position?
NB: dominance is NOT an offence in itself

*STEP 1: Market Definition – what is the relevant market?
* Approach: CCCS has discretion to arrive at its own definition of the relevant market and is not bound to accept the market definition forwarded by a dominant firm, following the methodology outlined in the CCCS Guidelines on Market Definition.

* First, define the relevant product and geographic markets
o Relevant product market: Define all the products on the demand side that buyers regard as reasonable substitutes to the “focal product” (product being examined). Then identify all the suppliers of the focal and substitute products
o Geographic market: Define the geographical market

* TEST for determining the relevant product market: Hypothetical Monopolist Test; E.g. Small but Significant Non-Transitory Increase in Price (SSNIP) test is one method to establish the relevant market
o Assume relevant market only has one firm (‘hypothetical monopolist’). If it imposes a SSNIP, what will a significant number of consumers do? If they switch to another firm, include that firm in the relevant market (that firm is a competitive constraint on the first firm). Repeat by asking what will happen if both firms impose a SSNIP (and so on and so forth).
o E.g. Heineken/Tiger Beer – tried to claim as wide as possible, asked for the market to be “all kinds of beers”. The test is, if Tiger increased by 30c, would people switch to other kinds of beers? If so, then that’s the market. If not, then Tiger Beer forms its own product group.
o Economics advice is always key to identifying markets, especially in contentious cases.


* Temporal markets: Timing in production and purchasing can affect market definition as well (CCCS Guidelines on Market Definition [5.1])
o Peak and off-peak services: Some buyers may not view peak and off-peak services as substitutable
o Seasonal variations: Products “may only exist to a limited extent during certain time periods”
o Innovation/inter-generational products: Consumers may defer expenditure on present products if they expect innovation will soon produce better substitutes, or if their previous generation product is a close substitute for the current generation

* E.g. SATS/SFI 3 December 2008 (CCCS 100/1303/08)
o SATS submitted to the CCCS that its relevant markets were: the provision of contract food services, supply of processed foods, and wholesale distribution of food products.
o CCCS further narrowed down the “provision of contract foods services” market into 4 sub-categories, with one of the segments being healthcare sector, comprising of hospitals and nursing home. Others being business/industrial sector, education sector and uniformed sector.
o The CCCS determined that, from a supply-side perspective, a provider would require the technical expertise of dieticians and nutritionists to devise menus that cater to patients’ needs. It will also need staff with experience in running contract food services in the context of hospitals. These restrict the number of providers.

*STEP 2: Dominance - market power or market share as a proxy of power
* Definition of “undertaking”
o s2(1) CA: any person, being an individual, a body corporate, an unincorporated body of persons or any other entity, capable of carrying on commercial or economic activities relating to goods or services
o s33(1) CA: undertaking abusing the dominant position can be located outside Singapore, but the abuse must have effect in Singapore

* TEST: In assessing dominance, undertaking’s ability to profitably sustain prices above competitive levels (para 3.5, CCCS Guidelines on s47) OR to restrict output or quality below competitive levels will be considered
o Existing competitors: This refers to competition from undertakings already in the relevant market, to whom buyers might switch if the alleged dominant undertaking sustained prices above competitive levels. The market shares of competitors in the relevant market are one measure of the competitive constraints from existing competitors; 
o Potential competitors: This refers to the possibility that undertakings will enter the relevant market and gain market share at the expense of an alleged dominant undertaking seeking to sustain prices above competitive levels. The strength of potential competition is affected by barriers to entry; and/or 
o Other factors, such as the existence of powerful buyers and economic regulation

* Factor: Market share: “An undertaking’s market share is an important factor in assessing dominance but does not, on its own, determine whether an undertaking is dominant.” (para 3.6, CCCS Guidelines on s47)
o “Generally, as a starting point, CCCS will consider a market share above 60% as likely to indicate that an undertaking is dominant” (para 3.9, CCCS Guidelines on s47)
o In general, SMEs will not be capable of conduct that has an appreciable adverse effect on competition (para 3.10, Guidelines on s47)
o On measuring market share, see Guidelines on s 47 Annex A [9.6]-[9.8]

* Factor: Entry Barriers: “An undertaking with a large market share in a market protected by significant entry barriers is likely to have market power.” (para 3.12, CCCS Guidelines on s47). For e.g.:
o Sunk costs;
o Limited access to key inputs and distribution outlets;
o Regulation;
o Economies of scale;
o Economies of scope;
o Network effects;
o Purchasing efficiencies; and 
o Exclusionary behaviour by incumbents (para 3.13, CCCS Guidelines on s47)

* Factor: Strength of buyer: “The strength of buyers and the structure of the buyers’ side of the market may constrain the market power of a seller. Buyer power requires that the buyer has a choice between alternate sellers.” (para 3.15, CCCS Guidelines on s47); buyer’s bargaining strength enhanced if:
o “the buyer is well-informed about alternative sources of supply and could readily, at little cost to itself, switch substantial purchases from one seller to another while continuing to meet its needs; 
o the buyer could commence production of the item itself, or “sponsor” new entry by another seller relatively quickly, for example, through a long-term contract, without incurring substantial sunk costs (i.e. irretrievable costs); 
o the buyer is an important outlet for the seller, that is, the seller would be willing to cede better terms to the buyer in order to retain the opportunity to sell to that buyer; and/or 
o the buyer can intensify competition among sellers through establishing a procurement auction or purchasing through a competitive tender.”

* Factor: Collective Dominance: “when two or more legally independent undertakings, from an economic point of view, present themselves or act together on a particular market as a collective entity.” (para 3.17, CCCS Guidelines on s47)
o “CCCS will examine whether there are links or factors that give rise to a connection between the undertakings concerned.” (para 3.19, Guidelines on s47)

* Factor: Price responsiveness of competitors: limited capacity/responsiveness = undertaking can more easily increase prices (See Guidelines on s47 Annex A [9.4])

*STEP 3: Abusive Conduct - refers to exclusionary conduct or conduct resulting in foreclosure to markets
* Foreclosure can be horizontal or vertical. 
o Horizontal: Dominant firm, through exclusionary practices, prevents a competitor form participating in the market it supplies to
o Vertical: An example is where the dominant firm supplies to its subsidiary but refuses to supply to the subsidiary’s competitor in a downstream market

* Dominance, abuse, and effects of abuse need not be in the same market (Guidelines on s 47 [4.7])

* TEST is an effects-based assessment: In determining if an abuse has occurred, the CCCS will consider the likely effects of the dominant firm’ conduct on competition based on the specific facts and circumstances on each case (SISTIC (SGCAB), [287])
o An abuse is established when a competition authority demonstrates that a practice has an adverse effect on the process of competition
o It is sufficient to show a *likely effect, and not necessary to show an actual effect on competition 
o If an effect or likely effect on restricting competition by the dominant undertaking is established, the dominant undertaking can advance an objective justification – may show that there are countervailing benefits from the behavior so that it has a net positive effect on welfare
o In SISTIC, the CCCS relied on the circular theory of harm which rests on the concurrent effects of discounts and exclusive agreements

o CCCS will consider “whether an alternative realistic situation from which the relevant conduct has been removed would be more competitive” (i.e. counterfactual analysis) (Guidelines on s 47 [4.8]). But assessment of counterfactuals is not a legal requirement (SISTIC (SGCAB), [315]) --> unlike in s54 merger control

* Undertaking’s conduct may constitute an abuse if it consists in (s47(2) CA): 
a. Predatory behaviour: Predatory behaviour towards competitors; OR 
b. Output limiting: Limiting production, market or technical development to the prejudice of consumers; OR
c. Discrimination: Apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; OR 
i. But note that discrimination is often a legitimate business strategy that isn’t anticompetitive. E.g. loyalty discounts, refusing to supply to difficult customers who don’t pay on time etc. 
ii. So it must be proven that the prevailing reason for the discrimination is to restrict competition 
d. Something like bundling: Make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts



Horizontal Foreclosure (against competitors)Vertical Foreclosure (against subsidiary’s competitors)Non-price based exclusion 
Single branding
- Where dominant supplier makes it such that customer is obliged to obtain all or most of its requirements in relation to a product from the same dominant supplier 

Bundling/Tying
- Where dominant firm supplies an important must-have product on a condition that the customer also buys another weaker product 
- E.g. EC fined Microsoft for bundling its Windows Media Player with its Windows Operating System 

Full line forcing
- Where dominant manufacturer supplies a dominant product to a retailer on a condition that the retailer buys all the products in the same range as the dominant product 
Refusal to deal 
- Where dominant upstream firm refuses to supply a key input required by downstream firms, especially if dominant firm has the capacity to do so and the downstream firms are willing to pay market rates 
- Note: Refusal to deal can be for legitimate reasons like poor credit worthiness of the downstream firm 

Constructive refusal 
- Dominant upstream firm offers to only do business with downstream firm on restrictive terms that are tantamount to a refusal to supply 
- E.g. of restrictive terms like uncommercial delivery conditions
- E.g. Mercedes sells replacement parts to 3p workshops at extremely high prices, or very long delivery delays etc. – in order to get people to come to Mercedes workshops Price based exclusion 
Loyalty rebates
- Generally pro-competitive but can be structured anti-competitive if it is designed to lock in a specific customer’s entire needs so that equally efficient competitors are unable to compete effectively 
- E.g. Intel was fined SGD$2.1 billion for awarding rebates to major computer manufacturers such as HP and Dell on condition that they purchase all of their x-86 CPU supplies from Intel 

Predation 
- Dominant firm setting its prices so low below average variable cost such that it forces other competitors out of the market 
- Dominant firm may be okay with incurring losses in the short run with a view to extracting monopoly profits in the long run 
Margin squeeze
- Dominant upstream supplier also operates as a retailer and sets a low margin between wholesale price and retail price => Forcing other equally efficient competitors in downstream retail market to exit 

Discrimination 
- Dominant upstream firm applies dissimilar conditions to two equivalent transactions with two downstream firms 
- E.g. of Discrimination: Refusal to deal and Constructive refusal 
* Single branding/exclusive dealing:  Arrangement where a customer is obliged to obtain all or most requirements from one supplier
o E.g. Exclusive agreements with venue owners and event promoters to use SISTIC exclusively “are explicitly exclusionary in nature and have led to substantial foreclosure effects on competition in the Relevant Market, all to the determent of the consumers, as market entry, market access and growth opportunities for existing or potential competition are stifled” in SISTIC (SGCAB), [317] --> SISTIC’s requirements that promoters presenting events at Esplanade and Singapore Indoor Stadium sell tickets through SISTIC, notwithstanding the efficiencies claimed by SISTIC and the fact that such exclusivity agreements were terminable
o E.g. as counterfactuals, without the Exclusive Agreements, event promoters will be able to choose preferred ticketing service providers free from total purchase commitments, ticketing service providers can compete fairly based on own merits such as customer service, technical capability, operational efficiency and product innovation, etc. in SISTIC (SGCAB), [315]
o Theory of harm origins: Chicago School defence for exclusive dealing vs post-Chicago school literature refuting it in certain circumstances: markets with network effect, lack of coordination among buyers, discriminatory offers exploiting contractual externalities, buyers that are downstream competitors, raise rivals’ cost, staggered expiry dates of different exclusive contracts (A7.1.6, Notice of ID SISTIC)
o Theory of harm: foreclosure of competition in a two-sided market: “exclusive purchasing obligations can critically impair competition in a two-sided market with indirect network effects by preventing the potentially-equally-efficient firm from attaining critical mass. In particular, the total commitment to use SISTIC as the sole ticketing service provider prevents the potentially-equally-efficient firm from picking up the residual demands of event promoters and accumulating network effects progressively. When event promoters and venue operators are bound to choose one ticketing service provider only for all their events, then they would perennially prefer SISTIC.” (A7.2.4, Notice of ID SISTIC)
o Theory of harm: ability to recoup sacrificed profits in a two-sided market: “There are two distinct groups of customers in a two-sided market. When most customers from one side are locked in, competition is foreclosed on both sides. This is true in the Relevant Market, because when key venue operators and event promoters are engaged by SISTIC exclusively, the ticket buyers will have little choice but to buy tickets from SISTIC in order to attend the events they want.” (A7.2.6, Notice of ID SISTIC)
o Theory of harm: titled price structure in a two-sided market [that shifts relative price level between two groups while maintaining an absolute combined price level]: “So long as recurrent profits continue to be generated from ticket buyers, SISTIC can afford to perpetuate its discounts and incentives to attract and retain venue operators and event promoters exclusively. There is no need to recoup sacrificed profits by exploiting event promoters or venue operators. There is also no need to sacrifice profits to attract and retain ticket buyers.” (A7.2.9, Notice of ID SISTIC)

* Bundling/tying: Where a dominant firm supplies a conduct on condition that a customer also buys another product. In most cases, the tying product is a must-have product, and the tied product is a weaker product.
o In 2004, the EU Commission fined Microsoft for bundling Windows Media Player with Windows OS.

* Full line forcing: A form of sales where, in order to obtain a must-have product in a manufacturer’s range, the retailer is require to stock all the products in that range

* Loyalty rebates and volume discounts: Generally pro-competitive. However, rebate schemes can be structured anti-competitively by being designed to lock-in a specific customer’s entire needs in relation to a certain product so that equally efficient competitors are unable to compete effectively. For example, a retailer may only qualify for a rebate if it purchases all or most of its products from the dominant firm.
o Intel was fined for awarding rebates to major computer manufacturers (e.g. HP and Dell) on condition that they purchase all or almost all of their CPU supplies from Intel

* Predation: Where a dominant firm sets its prices so low, especially below average variable cost (“AVC”), such that it forces competitors out of the market
o Dominant firm may deliberately incur losses in the short run, with a view to extracting monopoly rent in the long run
o Price below AVC = presumption of predation (Guidelines on s 47 [11.4])
o Price above AVC but below average total cost = evidence of predation (Guidelines on s 47 [11.4])
o Price above average total cost = No evidence of predation (Guidelines on s 47 [11.4])

* Refusal to deal: Dominant firm refuse to supply a key input required for downstream operations to its subsidiary’s competitors (especially where the manufacturer has capacity and the buyer is prepared to pay market rates)

* Constructive refusal: A dominant upstream supplier offers to do business on such restrictive terms (e.g. uncommercial delivery conditions) that it is tantamount to a refusal to supply

* Margin Squeeze: Where a vertically integrated firm, dominant in its supply of key inputs for a downstream market in which it also operates, sets a low margin for between its input price (i.e. wholesale price) and the price in the downstream market (i.e. retail price) such that an equally efficient competitor is forced to exit the downstream market.
o Xavier: This is how I understand margin squeeze: In order to establish a margin squeeze, we need three pieces of information: 1) the price the dominant firm’s subsidiary charges for the product, 2) the costs it incurs absent the costs associated with the input, and 3) the price of the input charged to the subsidiary’s competitor. If the sum of (2) and (3) is equal to or higher than (1), the margin is zero or negative and there is a margin squeeze. In that case, anticompetitive effects highly likely, especially if the input is indispensable for the production of the product.

* Discrimination: Application of dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions. Refusal to deal and constructive refusal (above) are aspects of discrimination.
o “Price discrimination may raise issues under the section 47 prohibition only where there is evidence that it is used to harm competition”, eg. discriminate to set predatory prices or an upstream dominant firm uses discriminatory pricing to apply a margin squeeze (Guidelines on s 47 [11.15])

Grounds of exclusion for s47 prohibition in the Third Schedule of CA
s47 prohibition does not apply to matters specified in the Third Schedule (s48 CA):
1. Services of general economic interest (para 1)
2. Compliance with legal requirements (para 2)
3. Avoidance of conflict with international obligations (para 3)
4. Public policy (by Minister’s order) (para 4)
5. Goods and services regulated by other competition law (para 5) and specified activities (para 6)
o Industries with their sectoral competition laws include: Telecommunications (IMDA), Media (IMDA), Energy (EMA), Postal (IMDA), Airports (CAAS), Cargo (MPA), Public transport (LTA), Portable water and wastewater (PUB), Armed security (MHA/SPF), and Financial Services (MAS)

Para 6 Third Schedule CA —(1)  The section 34 prohibition and the section 47 prohibition do not apply to any agreement or conduct which relates to any specified activity.
(2)  In this paragraph, “specified activity” means —
(a)	the supply of ordinary letter and postcard services by a person licensed and regulated under the Postal Services Act 1999;
(b)	the supply of piped potable water;
(c)	the supply of wastewater management services, including the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater;
(d)	the supply of bus services by a licensed bus operator under the Bus Services Industry Act 2015;
(e)	the supply of rail services by any person licensed and regulated under the Rapid Transit Systems Act 1995; and
(f)	cargo terminal operations carried out by a person licensed and regulated under the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act 1996.

6. Clearing houses (para 7)
7. Vertical agreements (para 8): 
o “(2) … “vertical agreement” means any agreement entered into between 2 or more undertakings each of which operates, for the purposes of the agreement, at a different level of the production or distribution chain, and relating to the conditions under which the parties may purchase, sell or resell certain goods or services and includes provisions contained in such agreements which relate to the assignment to the buyer or use by the buyer of intellectual property rights, provided that those provisions do not constitute the primary object of the agreement and are directly related to the use, sale or resale of goods or services by the buyer or its customers.”
8. Agreement with net economic benefit (para 9)
(a) improving production or distribution; or
(b) promoting technical or economic progress,
but which does not —
(c) impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of those objectives; or
(d) afford the undertakings concerned the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the goods or services in question.”
9. Mergers (para 11) and provisions directly related to and necessary to implementation of mergers (para 10)

Managing risk of breaching s 47
* Firms can notify for guidance or decision.
* *POTENTIAL DEFENCE: firms can consider if their conduct is objectively justified with countervailing benefits so that there is a net positive effect on welfare. 
o An example of objective justification for price discrimination in selected industries includes Ramsey pricing, where overall social welfare is maximised by charging higher prices to a group of customers with less elastic demand (e.g. movie tickets)
o An example of objective justification for predatory pricing includes the need to consider long-run incremental costs, which examines the long-run cost of providing an output rather than on a short-term per unit basis (e.g. infrastructure sectors). Especially in industries with high fixed costs and low variable costs

Consequences of Infringement
* Financial penalty: Where there is intentional or negligent infringement, penalty “not exceeding 10% of the turnover of the business of an undertaking in Singapore for each year of infringement may be imposed for a maximum period of three (3) years” (Guidelines on s 47 [8.1])
* CCCS can direct any person to take action to remedy, mitigate, or eliminate adverse effects and prevent the recurrence of such infringement (Guidelines on s 47 [8.2-8.3])
* CCCS remedies must account for:
* Severity and duration of abusive conduct
* Structure of relevant market
* Existing competition
* Possible impact of remedies on efficiency and innovation
* CCCS remedies can take the form of prohibitory conduct remedies, affirmative conduct remedies, structural remedies or a combination
* Right of private action after CCCS has determined that s47 was infringed and after appeal process has been exhausted (Guidelines on s47 [8.5])


4. *Merger control (s54 CA) [MARKET STRUCTURE PROHIBITION]

Prohibition: “mergers that have resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market in Singapore for goods or services are prohibited.” (s54(1) CA)

Element 1: Whether merger is covered under s54
* Merger occurs if:
(a) two or more merge;
(b) direct or indirect control of another; or
(c) acquisition of substantial assets of another.
--> Mergers and Acquisitions, amalgamations, and consolidations all count as a ‘merger’

s54(2) CA: For the purposes of this Part, a merger occurs if —
(a) 2 or more undertakings, previously independent of one another, merge;
(b) one or more persons or other undertakings acquire direct or indirect control of the whole or part of one or more other undertakings; or
(c) the result of an acquisition by one undertaking (the first undertaking) of the assets (including goodwill), or a substantial part of the assets, of another undertaking (the second undertaking) is to place the first undertaking in a position to replace or substantially replace the second undertaking in the business or, as appropriate, the part concerned of the business in which that undertaking was engaged immediately before the acquisition.

* A joint venture also constitutes a merger under s54(2)(b) (s54(5) CA).
* The JV (with joint control) must perform on a lasting basis, all the functions of an autonomous economic entity

* Acquisition of Control: Exercise “decisive influence […] with regard to the composition, voting or decisions of the organs of an undertaking” (s54(3) CA)
* Legal control: 
* Decisive influence exists with >50 % of voting rights
* 30%-50% then there is rebuttable presumption of decisive influence (Guidelines on Substantive Assessment of Mergers [3.10])
* De Facto control: No precise criteria, so assessed on a case-by-case basis. 
* CCCS will consider if there are “any additional agreements with the undertaking that allow the party to influence the undertaking’s activities that affect its key strategic commercial behaviour.” (Guidelines on Substantive Assessment of Mergers [3.12])
* VC and private equity investors may raise concerns “if they result in coordination of conduct among firms within their portfolios in the same market in which they have stakes and are able to influence their commercial behaviours.” (Guidelines on Substantive Assessment of Mergers [3.14])

* *Minority shareholders can also acquire control if they can exercise decisive influence, e.g. if they can “veto decisions that are essential for the strategic commercial behaviour of the undertaking, such as the budget, business plans, major investments, the appointment of senior management or market-specific rights” (Guidelines on Substantive Assessment of Mergers [3.17]), or where one achieves control due to patterns of attendance and voting (of other shareholders) in shareholders’ meetings (Guidelines on Substantive Assessment of Mergers [3.18])

Types of mergers: horizontal, vertical, conglomerate
a. Horizontal mergers: Mergers between firms in the same market that operate on the same level of the supply chain

b. Vertical Mergers: Mergers between firms that operate on at different but complementary levels of production and distribution (e.g. supplier and downstream client)

c. Conglomerate Mergers: Mergers between firms that operate in different product markets, where the products share sufficient characteristics to be considered a discrete group
* Portfolio power: Where products share sufficient characteristics to be considered a discrete group, a customer may have an incentive to purchase the portfolio from the merged entity to reduce its transaction costs. This circumstance may substantially lessen competition if competitors don’t impose substantial competitive constraints on a firm with portfolio power.

EXCEPTIONS: mergers which are not prohibited by s54 CA
s54 prohibition does not apply to any merger specified in Fourth Schedule CA (s55 CA):
1. Any merger: 
a. Merger approved by any Minister or regulatory authority other than the Commission pursuant to any requirement for such approval imposed by any written law
b. Merger approved by MAS
c. Merger approved under the jurisdiction of any regulatory authority other than the Commission under any written law relating to competition, or code of practice relating to competition issued under any written law 
2. Specified activities: Any merger involving any undertaking relating to any specified activity as defined in paragraph 6(2) of Third Schedule – which are:
a. the supply of ordinary letter and postcard services by a person licensed and regulated under the Postal Services Act 1999;
b. the supply of piped potable water;
c. the supply of wastewater management services, including the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater;
d. the supply of bus services by a licensed bus operator under the Bus Services Industry Act 2015;
e. the supply of rail services by any person licensed and regulated under the Rapid Transit Systems Act 1995; and
f. cargo terminal operations carried out by a person licensed and regulated under the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act 1996.
3. Merger which creates more economic efficiencies than SLC: Any merger if the economic efficiencies arising or that may arise from the merger outweigh the adverse effects due to the substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market in Singapore

Element 2: Substantial lessening of competition (SLC) in the market
* In determining whether a merger results in a substantial lessening of competition, the CCCS will have regard to “qualitative rather than quantitative criteria, focusing on the concept of control.” (CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [3.2])

* One of the indicative quantitative thresholds it has established is as follows: Competition concerns are “unlikely to arise in a merger situation unless:
o the merged entity will have a market share of 40% or more; or
o the merged entity will have a market share of between 20% to 40% and the post-merger [combined market share of the three largest firms] is 70% or more” (CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [5.15])

* However, quantitative thresholds are indicative and NOT decisive – the CCCS may still investigate merger situations that fall below the quantitative thresholds. Thus, crossing the threshold does not automatically result in a finding of SLC, it just means the CCCS will investigate to look at qualitative thresholds

* Assessment of Counterfactuals: 
o “CCCS will evaluate the competitive situation with and without the merger situation.” (CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [4.14])
o “CCCS may need to take into account likely and imminent changes in the structure of competition in order to reflect as accurately as possible the nature of rivalry without the merger.” (CCCS Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [4.16]). Such changes include announced and impending entry and/or exit of firms
o When comparing the “likely state of competition” with and without the merger, CCCS will consider the following factors: 
1. Market shares and concentration: Number and size of firms in a market 
2. Barriers to entry and expansion: The extent to which existing competitors would expand their sales or new competitors would enter and compete effectively if prices were increased
3. Countervailing buyer power: Potential for seller to be sufficiently constrained by the ability of one or more buyers to exert substantial influence on negotiations



Theories of harm
* In conducting a merger assessment, and after the CCCS has developed the counterfactual, it may examine the merger as to whether any theories of harm apply. Developing theories of harm provides a framework for assessing potential changes arising from the merger. Theories of harm includes:
o Market foreclosure, generally
o Non-coordinated effects (unilateral effects – without any collusion between remaining parties)
o Coordinated effects (i.e. any increase in probability of collusion after merger?)

* CCCS will consider how rivalry will be affected post-merger. A merger between 2 competing firms may harm the rivalry process in terms of price, quantity sold, service quality, product range, product quality or innovation

* 2 principal effects a competition regulator will examine: Non-coordinated effects and Coordinated effects

A. Non-coordinated effects
A. Non-coordinated effects: Merged firm unilaterally finds it profitable to raise prices or reduce output/quality/innovation due to loss of competition between the merged entities (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.5]), or where market power is preserved due to merging with potential/emerging competitor (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.7])
* Non-exhaustive factors examined by the CCCS in assessing non-coordinated effects include purchasing behaviour, switching trends, buyer power, capacity constraints and factors of production
* Non-coordinated effects may arise where:
- there are few firms in the affected markets, 
- merging parties have large market shares and/or are close rivals, 
- merger involves important innovators, 
- customers have little choice of alternatives, 
- difficult for rivals to respond to changes in price/output/quality, or 
- a merger party is a strong potential new entrant (and thus its elimination changes competitive dynamics) (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.13])

o Non-coordinated effects may occur in any market:
* Markets with homogenous products: Merged firm may find it profitable to restrict output if:
- remaining competitors don’t have capacity to replace the output, 
- the merged entity has large market share, 
- customers are insensitive to price increases, and/or 
- it won’t forego much profit by selling less output (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.10])
* Markets with differentiated products: “non-coordinated effects may arise where a merger between firms previously supplying close substitutes is likely able to cause an increase in the price of either or both of the close substitutes.” (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.11])
- Consider “nature and proportion of substitution”
- Larger volume of sales diverted between merging firms = Greater incentive to raise prices
- Larger profit margins on diverted sales between merging firms = Greater incentive to raise prices 

o **SUMMARY of non-coordinated effects which may arise when the markets concerned possess some of the following characteristics:
* there are few firms in the affected market(s); 
* the merger parties have large market shares;
- larger the market share of the merged entity, the more likely it is that a merger will lead to a significant increase in market power. Although market shares and increases in market shares provide only an indication of market power and an increase in market power, they are normally important factors in the assessment; 
* the merger parties are close rivals;
- higher the degree of substitutability between the merging firms’ products, the more likely it is that the merging firms will raise prices significantly. If the merging firms represent, for a substantial number of customers, the “next best alternative” to each other’s products, those customers would be prevented from switching to the best rival product, in the event of a post-merger price increase; 
* one or more merging parties are important innovators in ways not reflected in market shares; 
* customers have little choice of alternative suppliers that they are able to switch to, whether because of the absence of alternatives, substantial switching costs, or the ability of suppliers to price discriminate; 
* it is difficult for rivals to react quickly to changes in price, output, or quality, e.g. through product repositioning or supply-side substitution; 
* there is little spare capacity in the hands of the merged entity’s competitors that would allow them to expand to supply customers in the event that the merged entity reduces output, and there is little prospect of expansion of existing capacity. 
- Spare capacity is likely to be considered in greater detail in those markets which have homogenous products; 
* there is no strong competitive fringe capable of sustaining sufficient levels of post-merger rivalry; or 
* one of the merger parties is a recent new entrant or a strong potential new entrant that may have had a significant competitive effect on the market since its entry or which was expected to grow into an effective competitive force. Its elimination may thus mean an important change in the competitive dynamics

B. Coordinated effects
B. Coordinated effects: Arises where a merger reduces the competitive constraints in a market, thus creating the ability to increase prices or conditions conducive for firms in the same market to coordinate behaviours (probability of colluding). It can arise from low number of market players
* Non-exhaustive factors examined by the CCCS in assessing coordinated effects include level of concentration in the market, degree of homogeneity of the firms’ products, buyer power, whether any significant entry barriers exist, and the stability of demand and costs

Possible defence: ease of market entry
* Possible DEFENCE against reduction in rivalry flowing from merger: Market entry by new competitors (i.e. low barriers to entry and expansion)
o *Entry must be “timely and sustainable to provide lasting and effective post-merger competition.” (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.41])
* Assessment depends on facts of specific merger and particular characteristics of the market(s)
* Non-exhaustive factors to consider: Barriers to entry, frequency of transactions, nature and duration of contracts between buyers and sellers, time required to achieve necessary scale (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.42])
* E.g. In markets where products are supplied on a long-term contractual basis, customers may not immediately be exposed to the detrimental effects of an SLC. Have to consider the renewal dates of the contracts
o “As an indication, CCCS may consider entry within two (2) years as timely entry, but this is assessed on a case by case basis” (Guidelines on the Substantive Assessment of Mergers [6.41])
o The effect of a merger on the likelihood of a new entry might itself contribute to a SLC if it increases barriers to entry or reduces/eliminates the competitive constraint represented by the new entry
o Other factors:
* Maturity of market – a mature market with steady or declining demand is less favourable for new entrants. New entrants have to win over existing customers from competitors, instead of targeting new customers entering the market. 
* Structural barriers to entry – economies of scale, high sunk costs, network effects, purchasing efficiencies (benefits of purchasing multiple types of things from one vendor) 
* Strategic barriers – first mover advantages, built up goodwill/reputation, established long-term contracts, loyalty points programs etc.

Possible defence: net economic efficiencies
* This falls under the exclusion from s54 prohibition (Paragraph 3, Fourth Schedule CA): “The section 54 prohibition does not apply to any merger if the economic efficiencies arising or that may arise from the merger outweigh the adverse effects due to the substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market in Singapore.”

* However, mergers that only create profits for the companies concerned are unlikely to benefit from the exclusion
o No explicit requirement to demonstrate pass-through of merger benefits to customers, but it is likely to be persuasive
o Other examples: removal of double mark-up, increase in investment, increase in variety of products, network effects, one-stop shopping, price effects of complementary products, product innovation

* Detailed and verifiable evidence is required, which include:
o Confidential information prepared by or for the parties concerning the rationale for the merger
o Confidential reports or papers for Board Members and/or Senior Management
o Past behaviour by and future intentions of the merging parties and/or relevant third parties

CCCS Voluntary merger control regime – notification of CCCS for decision
SUMMARY (Para 2.3-2.4 of CCCS Guidelines on Merger Procedure):
* Merger parties have no obligation to notify their merger situations to CCCS either before or after implementation of merger
o Merger parties only have a mandatory responsibility to self-assess their merger and decide if it wants to notify the CCCS to apply for a decision 
o But this does NOT mean that filing is optional, a failure to notify where it is required to do so is an infringement in itself

* No suspensory effect, i.e. no express approval from CCCS is required before completion of merger

* Parties are strongly encouraged to notify CCCS prior to the completion of merger, which allows more scope for parties to consider potential remedies
o If parties elect to notify post-closing of merger, there is a risk that CCCS will not accept a post-closing filing on the basis that it intends to investigate the transaction instead

* Effect of non-compliance: when merger parties decide not to notify CCCS, parties have to bear the “antitrust risk” of carrying on with the merger and infringing Singapore’s competition laws
o CCCS can investigate mergers on its own initiative to determine if there was a SLC
o If CCCS finds that merger situation leads to a SLC, CCCS has powers to give directions which include dissolution or modification of the merger (including a divestment of all or part of a business) and the imposition of financial penalties (penalties are higher if thresholds are crossed but not notified to CCCS)

Review procedure: two-phase approach
* Two-phase approach: Phase 1 is generally completed within 30 working days. If the CCCS is unable to conclude that the merger does not raise competition concerns, the review may move into Phase 2, which can take up to 120 working days.
* Where the CCCS decides that a completed merger (or anticipated merger, if carried out into effect) will infringe the s 54 prohibition, it may require that the completed merger be unwound (or that the anticipated merger not proceed)
* Securities Industry Council’s Practice Statement on Merger Procedures of the CCCS required that:
o A mandatory offer under Rule 14 of Takeover Code to be subject to the Relevant Condition
o A voluntary offer to include the Relevant Condition as one of the conditions to the offer
* In addition, the voluntary offer may be subject to condition that the CCCS issues a favourable decision during a Phase 1 review
* Notwithstanding the subjectivity rule in Rule 15.1 of the Takeover Code, the offeror may state that the decision must be on terms favourable to it.
* ‘Relevant Condition’: the offer will lapse “if the CCCS (i) makes a decision to proceed to a Phase 2 review, or (ii) issues a direction that prohibits the offeror from acquiring voting rights in the offeree company”


5. Enforcement
a. Commitments to remedy
* CCCS can require parties to make commitments to remedy competition concerns before merger (Paras 6.2 to 6.3 of CCCS Guidelines on Merger Procedure)
o CCCS may accept commitments from applicant merger parties at any time during Phase 1 review, Phase 2 review or before a final decision has been made 
o Commitments are aimed to remedy, mitigate or prevent the competition concerns from arising from the merger situation 
o Commitments are binding on parties when accepted by CCCS and can be enforced by CCCS via the Courts 
o s60A and s60B CA: Validity and effect of commitments

* Mergers may be cleared by the parties offering commitments (s 60A) and divestments
o s60A(1) CA: “a commitment to take or refrain from taking such action as it considers appropriate for the purpose of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial lessening of competition or any adverse effect which —
* may be expected to result from the anticipated merger, if carried into effect; or
* has resulted or may be expected to result from the merger.”

* E.g. Notice of ID Grab-Uber: s 54 merger
o Para 344: “CCCS has considered the Second Commitments Proposal and is of the view that it would not be appropriate or sufficient to address the SLC concerns in the Platform Market arising post-Transaction. For example, CCCS notes that: 
* “a. Grab’s non-exclusivity commitments does not cover exclusivity restrictions on taxi rental fleet partners which would allow Grab to prevent its partners from reaching agreements to work with other operators; 
* b. Grab’s proposal allows Grab to continue to impose exclusivity obligations on drivers with ongoing exclusive contracts; 
* Uber’s proposal that it or LCR is free to sell LCR’s assets to any third party in the absence of a reasonable offer, which will not be deemed to be reasonable in the case where the offer is to acquire less than 75% of its assets (except for an offer for only unhired vehicles), would also render the proposed commitment to sell vehicles to a Potential Competitor ineffective in most cases, and restrict a Potential Competitor’s ability to access LCR’s existing cars and drivers; and/or 
* While CCCS is agreeable to the Parties’ proposal that they should be allowed to apply for CCCS to vary the directions should market conditions change, the proposal for Grab to be released from all the proposed commitments as long as any combination of competitors achieves more than 20% of market share based on the number of rides, and the proposal that the relevant commitments which are the subject of Grab’s application shall cease to apply to Grab automatically after 14 working days from the date of Grab’s application, would mean the commitments may cease to be effective prematurely.”

* E.g. Proposed acquisition by London Stock Exchange Group of Refinitiv Holdings (CCCS/400/140/2020/004): s 54 merger
o “LSEG submitted the Final Commitments … [incorporating feedback from CCCS and] incorporating further amendments in response to the feedback received from the public consultation that CCCS agreed with. With the amendments made by LSEG to address the abovementioned feedback from third parties, CCCS considers the Final Commitments sufficient to address the competition concerns which may arise from the Transaction.” (London Stock Exchange Group, [228])
o Commitments (Annex I of London Stock Exchange Group):
* “LSEG commits to make WM/R FX Benchmarks [offered by Refinitive, the merged entity] available to WM/R Customers that currently access or in the future make a request to access WM/R FX Benchmarks for index licensing or clearing purposes.” (para 3.1)
* “LSEG commits: 3.2.1 not to reclassify or redefine WM/R FX Benchmarks in a manner that would undermine the efficacy of the Commitment; and 3.2.2 to deal with WM/R Customers in relation to any future contracts regarding access to WM/R FX Benchmarks for index licensing or clearing purposes in good faith.” (para 3.2)
* LSEG shall appoint a Monitoring Trustee on the terms and conditions approved by the CCCS, and as set out in Schedule 1. (para 4.1) --> for a period of 10 years from the CCCS’ infringement decision

b. Directions to prohibit anticipated merger or to dissolve a merger
* CCCS can make directions to prohibit anticipated merger or to dissolve a merger (Paras 6.4 to 6.11 of CCCS Guidelines on Merger Procedure)
o CCCS may give directions as a result of unfavourable decision under Phase 2 or investigations concluding that s54 has been infringed 

* s69(2) CA include directions: 
o Prohibiting an anticipated merger from being carried into effect or requiring a merger to be dissolved or modified in such manner as CCCS may direct
o Requiring merger parties to enter agreements to prevent or lessen anti-competitive effects
o Requiring merger parties to dispose operations, assets or shares of an undertaking

* CCCS can register such directions with the District Court, after which it may be enforced as if it were an order of the District Court – s85 CA 
o Breach of such an order is treated as contempt of court

c. Financial penalties
* Requirement: “the Commission may impose a financial penalty only if it is satisfied that the infringement has been committed intentionally or negligently” (s69(3) CA)
o “intentionally”: “if the undertaking must have been aware that its conduct was of such a nature as to encourage a restriction or distortion of competition, and it is sufficient that the undertaking could not have been unaware of the same, without it being necessary to show that the undertaking also knew that it was infringing the Act” (para 375, Notice of ID Grab-Uber)
o “negligently”: “if the undertaking ought to have known that its conduct would result in an infringement … Ignorance or a mistake of law is no bar to a finding of intentional infringement under the Act.” (para 376, Notice of ID Grab-Uber)

* The financial penalty can be up to a maximum of 10% of the turnover in Singapore for each year of infringement for such period up to a maximum of 3 years preceding the CCCS’ infringement decision (s69(4) CA)
o E.g. Appeals allowed for 4 appellants reversing finding on one of two grounds for s 34 infringement also result in reduced sum of financial penalties payable in Fresh Chicken (SGCAB), [338]

Calculating financial penalty (para 396-419, Notice of ID Grab-Uber)
* Step 1: calculation of the base penalty (i.e. the % of the relevant turnover) having regard to:
o the nature and seriousness of the infringement 
o the turnover of the business of the undertaking in Singapore for the product and geographic markets affected by the infringement
o in the undertaking’s last business year = the FY preceding the year when the infringement ended
o Other factors: structure of the market and market shares of the Parties, effect on customers, competitors and third parties (para 397-399, Notice of ID Grab-Uber)

* Step 2: Duration of infringement: number of years x base amount

* Step 3: Aggravating and mitigating factors: Increase or decrease total penalty by a fixed %
a. Aggravating factors include (para 2.14, CCCS Guidelines on Appropriate Amount of Penalty): 
o “role of the undertaking as a leader in, or an instigator of, the infringement;
o involvement of directors or senior management [but mere involvement of the board is insufficient (SISTIC (SGCAB), [352])];
o retaliatory or other coercive measures taken against other undertakings aimed at ensuring the continuation of the infringement;
o continuance of the infringement after the start of investigation;
o repeated infringements by the same undertaking or other undertakings in the same group;
o unreasonable failure by an undertaking to respond to a request for financial information on business turnover and/or relevant turnover;
o in the case of bid-rigging or collusive tendering, CCCS may treat each infringement that an undertaking participates in, after the first infringement, as an aggravating factor and calibrate with a proportionate percentage increase in penalties;
o infringements which are committed intentionally rather than negligently; and
o retaliatory measures taken or commercial reprisal sought by the  undertaking against a leniency applicant.”

b. Mitigating factors include (para 2.15, CCCS Guidelines on Appropriate Amount of Penalty):
o “role of the undertaking, for example: that the undertaking was acting under severe duress or pressure; or in the context of a section 34 infringement, where the undertaking (a) provides evidence that its involvement in the infringement was substantially limited, and (b) demonstrates that, during the period in which it was party to the infringement, it actually avoided applying it by adopting competitive conduct in the market;
o genuine uncertainty on the part of the undertaking as to whether the agreement or conduct constituted an infringement;
o adequate steps taken with a view to ensuring compliance with the section 34 prohibition or section 47 prohibition, for example, existence of any compliance programme; 
o termination of the infringement as soon as CCCS intervenes; and 
o co-operation which enables the enforcement process to be concluded more effectively and/or speedily.”

* Step 4: Other relevant factors: Further adjustments
o “CCCS may also adjust the penalty as appropriate to achieve policy objectives, particularly the deterrence of the Parties and other undertakings from completing and consummating anti-competitive mergers that result in an SLC.” (para 417, Notice of ID Grab-Uber)

* Step 5: Adjustment to prevent maximum penalty being exceeded under s69(4) CA (i.e. up to a maximum of 10% of the turnover in Singapore for each year of infringement for such period up to a maximum of 3 years)

* Step 6: Adjustment for immunity, leniency reductions and/or fast track procedure discounts. (e.g. Panasonic was given immunity in the capacitor manufacters’ case)

d. Powers of the CCCS
* Power of investigation: the CCCS may investigate if reasonable grounds for suspecting infringements of prohibitions
o Power to require production of documents and information (s63 CA)
o Power to take copies or extracts of any documents
o Power to require any person to explain any relevant document, or state to the best of his knowledge or belief where it may be found
o Power to search any person if there are reasonable grounds to do so
o Power to take possession of relevant documents if necessary to protect it
* Power to enter premises and conduct raids (“dawn raids”) using force as is reasonably necessary, without warrant (s64 CA) and under warrant (s65 CA)
o CCCS can remove from the premises for examination any relevant equipment or article
* CCCS may also obtain information about firms, agreements, practices, and markets through informal inquiries, statutory documentary requests, and market studies

e. Appeals and Private Action
* Appeal against CCCS’ decision may be made to the Competition Appeal Board (s71 CA)
o The Competition Appeal Board has a maximum of 30 members appointed by the Minister (s72(1) CA)
* Appeal concerning point of law or decision concerning amount of financial penalty may be made from the Competition Appeal Board to the General Division of the High Court (s74(1) CA)
* Further appeals to appellate court: “There is such further right of appeal from decisions of the General Division of the High Court under this section as exists in the case of decisions made by the General Division of the High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction.” (s74(4) CA)
* Private Action: “Any person who suffers loss or damage directly” due to an infringement can bring a civil action against the infringing firm (s86(1) CA) after a decision (either by CCCS, CAB, GH(HC) or appellate court) establishing the prohibition has been infringed (s86(2) CA)

Case study: Grab/Uber – s54 SLC
Summary 
- CCCS blocked a sale of Uber’s SEA business to Grab in consideration of Uber holding a 27.5% stake in Grab, as it would result in a SLC in the market for 2-sided platforms matching drivers and riders for the provision of booked chauffeured point-to-point transport services (CPPT platform services) in Singapore
- It also imposed $13m in financial penalties on Grab Inc and Uber Technologies for a completed merger 
- Uber appealed the CCCS’ decision to the CAB, but CAB rejected the appeal  

Competition issues 
- Uber and Grab overlap in the provision of ridesharing services 
- The following theories of harm were considered: 
o Removing competition between Grab and Uber would allow the merged entity to increase prices or decrease quality and output, to the detriment of riders and drivers 
o The transaction may increase the likelihood that the remaining entities coordinate their behavior 
o The transaction may give Grab the incentive to tie car rental companies and drivers who rent from those companies into exclusive arrangements and increase barriers to entry in the industry 
- The counterfactual 
o The parties submitted that Uber had already made an irreversible decision to exit the Southeast Asia market, so the factual was the same as the counterfactual. 
o But the CCCS was not presented with any evidence to support the assertion that Uber would have left SEA no matter what – instead, found that Uber made the decision to exit SEA after agreeing to be bought out by Grab 
- Market definition 
o Another area of contention was whether Uber and Grab were really big players in their markets. The parties argued that they were in competition with the various public transport operators (bus and train etc.) as a whole, so they weren’t in a market dominant position 
o CCCS examined various aspects, such as public transport, booked taxi (CDG), street hail taxi 
o Concluded that public transport did not pose sufficient competitive constraints on the parties, in constraining the price of the focal product, for it to constitute part of the relevant market 
o Similarly for drivers 
o Conclusion – the parties were operating in the ridesharing platform market and the car rental market. 
o CCCS did take into consideration the competitive constraints posed by street hail, public transport, and the broader labor market, even though they were not included in the relevant market 
- Non-coordinated effects 
o As a result of the transaction, Grab increased its market power, manifested in its ability to raise prices, because of the elimination of competition between Grab and Uber 
* The Parties’ contemporaneous documents and funding estimates indicated that the Parties expected the transaction to increase Grab’s ability to increase effective price 
* Significant reduction in promotions and incentives post-transaction 
o Note – to demonstrate non-coordinated effects, CCCS does not need to show an actual increase in price, but only an increase in the parties’ ability to raise prices 
o The non-coordinated effects are unlikely to be averted by entry or expansion of other market players, since Grab and Uber were each other’s closest competitors 
- Coordinated effects 
o Characteristics of the market increased the likelihood of coordination between the remaining market players
* Small number of players and high concentration of the market – easy for firms to coordinate. There were only 6 ridesharing platform services prior to the transaction 
* High degree of transparency on pricing – easy for firms to observe other firms’ pricing and detect deviations from any tacit agreement 
* Repeated interaction enables sustainable coordination – the prospect of retaliation discourages firms from pursuing more competitive strategies 
* Competitive constraints are low – barriers to entry are high due to the network effects of the platform business model 
o Despite all this, no coordinated effects were suggested or were found to be likely 

Proposed commitments by Grab 
- First commitments proposal – proposed to commit to: 
o Cease exclusivity arrangements with taxis, car rentals, drivers and riders 
o Allow personal data porting to other ridesharing platforms
o Increase driver welfare and rider benefits 
o Undergo an algorithm freeze, to not increase surge factor and base fares 
o Ensure driver commission rates would not exceed pre-transaction levels 
- CCCS assessment of the first proposal
o Would not be appropriate or sufficient to address the SLC concerns
o The non-exclusivity commitments were conditional upon the other firms in Singapore also not entering into any exclusivity agreements. If even a small firm which didn’t pose serious competition to Grab entered an exclusivity agreement with a rental company, Grab’s commitment would cease 
o Driver welfare commitment lacked details, and it was not clear how it would be sufficient to address the competition issues 
o Algorithm freeze commitment – CCCS noted complaints that fares had increased post-transaction regardless of the commitment 
- Second commitments proposal 
o Reworded the non-exclusivity commitment to be more general 
o No further merger of Lion City Rentals with Grab
o If any new entrant/existing platform service provider makes a reasonable offer to purchase LCR, Uber/LCR must accept the offer unless CCCS raises objections. 
* Definition of reasonable – inter alia that the offer should be for at least 75% of LCR’s assets 
o Grab to maintain pre-transaction pricing for a period of 12 months from the date of the commitments 
- CCCS assessment of the 2nd proposal 
o Nope still not good enough 
o The non-exclusivity commitments do not cover exclusivity restrictions on taxi rental fleet partners which would allow Grab to prevent its partners from reaching agreements to work with other operators. 
* And it also allows Grab to continue imposing exclusivity obligations on drivers with existing exclusivity contracts 
o The commitment that LCR must accept reasonable purchase offers is defeated by the “reasonable” requirement. Would largely be ineffective if a competitor’s offer to purchase vehicles would not be deemed reasonable unless it was to purchase 75% of the assets 

Conclusion 
- After due consideration of the information obtained from the Parties and third parties, CCCS finds that the Transaction has resulted in an SLC in the Platform Market by removing competition between Grab and Uber, which were each other’s closest competitor in the Platform Market. 
- The merged entity is likely to have gained in its ability to increase effective price and has evidently done so since the completion of the Transaction. 
- Further, post-Transaction, Grab would have the ability and incentive to tie chauffeured private hire car (CPHC) rental companies (including Lion City Rentals) and drivers who rent from these CPHC rental companies in exclusive arrangements and reinforce its position in the Platform Market by increasing barriers to entry.

Infringement decision and action
- Determined the addressees of the decision (went to determine the Single Economic Entities of Grab and Uber based on their corporate structures and interactions between the various group companies) 
- CCCS considers that structural remedies are preferable to behavioural ones, as they tend to address the competition concerns created by the merger more directly and also require less monitoring.
- Directions for Grab 
o Remove all exclusivity obligations and cease to impose any more – for drivers, vehicle renters, taxi fleets 
o Lion City Rentals (LCR) shall not be sold to Grab without CCCS approval
o If any new entrant/existing CPPT platform service provider makes a reasonable offer based on fair market value to purchase all of Lion City Rentals’ shareholding, or all or part of the assets, Uber must accept the offer unless CCCS objects 
o Grab must maintain pre-transaction pricing and algorithm pricing matrix 
o The parties must amend the Purchase Agreement to remove restrictions on the acquirers to whom LCR could be sold, and the parties shall not play restrictions in relation to the use of LCR’s vehicles by any acquirer of LCR 
o Parties to appoint a Monitoring Trustee to monitor their compliance with the direction 
- Financial penalties 
o The parties were aware, or ought to have been aware, that there were competition concerns with the Transaction, since the merger combined by far the two largest providers of ridesharing platform services in Singapore and eliminated significant competition inter se 
o The parties did not use the voluntary disclosure regime, but instead opted for a quick call shortly before the transaction was entered into, during which CCCS reiterated the risks of the transaction. 
o Thus, the parties were at least negligent in breaching the s47 CA prohibition 

Case study: Seek/Jobstreet – s54 no SLC
Summary
- Proposed acquisition of JobStreet Singapore by SEEK Asia Investments Pte. Ltd: 
- SEEK offers online recruitment advertising services and recruitment solutions. JobsDB Singapore is involved in providing online recruitment advertising services and recruitment solutions in Singapore
- CCS found that the Proposed Acquisition will substantially lessen competition in the market for online recruitment advertising services in Singapore
- However, CCS has granted approval of the merger (i.e. no infringement of s54 CA), conditional upon the implementation of and compliance with the behavioural and divesture commitments offered by SEEK

Review by CCCS
- CCCS’ analysis of the transaction focuses on the acquisition by SEEK of the relevant Singapore JobStreet entity and operating business, which involves an acquisition of sole control and thus a merger pursuant to s54(2)(b) CA
- At the end of Phase 1 review, CCCS was unable to conclude based on available information at that time that the transaction did not raise competition concerns. SEEK proposed 2 separate commitments packages to address the competition concerns identified by CCCS, but CCCS concluded that neither could be accepted during Phase 1 review. CCCS then proceeded with a Phase 2 review of the transaction
- CCCS consulted existing and potential customers of the online recruitment platforms operated by SEEK and JobStreet in Singapore, actual and potential competitors to the online recruitment platforms, and obtained feedback from other participants in the market

What is the relevant market?
Product market
- CCCS identified the relevant focal product to be the provision of online recruitment advertising services by online job portals in Singapore. CCCS then made inquiries of both providers and customers of these services to identify what they regarded as reasonably substitutable services – as online recruitment advertising services belong to a 2-sided platform, CCCS also accounted for substitutable services from the point of view of jobseekers

- Is the relevant product market an online-only market or an online-plus-print market?
* CCCS’ market inquires support the position that print media is more complementary to, rather than in competition with, online advertisements
* Online and offline recruitment advertisements are not easily substitutable
* Thus, CCCS concluded that print media is unlikely to be a strong and effective competitive constraint against online recruitment advertising service providers

- CCCS’ assessment concluded that the relevant market for the transaction is the market for online recruitment advertising services, including resume database services
* Offline recruitment advertising services are generally NOT substitutable for online recruitment advertising services. Print media advertising for job postings is in decline in Singapore and therefore CANNOT be said to be an effective competitive constraint against online job portals. Thus, offline recruitment advertising services are NOT in the same product market as online recruitment advertising services
* Aggregators and other professional networking sites like LinkedIn do exert some competitive pressure on the parties such that they should be included in the online recruitment advertising services market, albeit having less competitive constraint as compared to other job portal competitors in the market
* CCCS concludes that the relevant product market include online recruitment advertisement services generally, but market players may offer differentiated products (i.e. broken down by professional or industrial sectors, e.g. banking jobs)

Geographic market
- SEEK submitted that the relevant geographic market for online recruitment advertising services is global in nature and not limited to any specific geographical location, giving the following reasons:
* Technically possible to post recruitment advertisements and resumes, as well as search through these advertisements and resumes, outside of Singapore
* Global online recruitment players are increasingly gaining traction for recruitment listings and there are no barriers to entry in Singapore. Customers in Singapore can source for online recruitment advertisement platforms outside of Singapore
* An online platform based outside Singapore may be tailored to list recruitment advertisements targeted at job openings in Singapore for local job seekers
- However, CCCS did not accept SEEK’s reasoning that the relevant market was global in nature – it was not presented with evidence to support the position that global online recruitment players are increasingly gaining traction for recruitment listings. Thus, CCCS concluded that the market for online advertising was national in geographic scope (i.e. limited to Singapore)

Counterfactual
- In assessing the transaction, CCCS considers the effect of the transaction by comparing the likely future competitive environment if the transaction proceeds (the likely “with” position) to the likely future competitive environment if the transaction does not proceed (the likely “without” position) to determine whether the transaction is likely to SLC in the relevant market
- SEEK submitted that in respect of the provision of online recruitment advertising services, the parties will continue to operate separately and independently in the absence of the transaction – and if so, they will lose an opportunity to achieve operational efficiencies and enhance their competitiveness against local and global competitors
- CCCS accepted that the relevant counterfactual position should the transaction not proceed is that the parties would continue to operate separately and independently in the absence of the transaction. However, it would also consider the Government’s new Jobs Bank initiative which only launched in July 2014. Thus, the relevant counterfactual position is a consideration of the competitive environment with and without the merger in circumstances which include Jobs Bank

Competition issues identified
- Theory of harm identified by CCCS is that the transaction would result in a horizontal merger in the market for the supply of online recruitment advertising services, including resume database search services in Singapore, which may give rise to a SLC
- CCCS formed the view that the transaction would likely give rise to the following non-coordinated effects:
a. Ability or incentive to change the structure of the market by demanding exclusive “lock-in” contracts which prevent customers from switching away from the merged firm;
b. Ability or incentive to bundle and tie products across its 2 brands which would have the effect or likely effect of preventing customers from switching away from the merged firm; and
c. Ability or incentive to impose price increases post-merger
- CCCS also considered other competition concerns:
a. Less innovation – in the absence of the competitive constraint each party imposes on another, in terms of the development of new and innovative products for employers and recruiters, the merged entity may over time tend to “give less and charge more”. This position may be exacerbated by the absence of strong and effective competition from other providers of online recruitment advertising services, given the large pool of jobseekers to which the merged entity will have access to
b. Less choice for advertisers and job seekers
c. Anti-competitive pricing strategies – merged entity is likely to have a significant advantage and lead position in the market for the provision of online recruitment advertising services. It would likely benefit from a number of efficiencies and cost savings. Post-merger it may use its market position and financial strength to substantially damage or eliminate competitors from the market

SEEK’s behavioural commitments
- SEEK proposed a set of behavioural commitments to address the adverse effects likely to arise as a consequence of the SLC if the transaction was carried into effect. CCCS also began a public consultation process on these behavioural commitments
a. To address the concern regarding exclusive “lock-in” agreements which prevent customers from switching away from the merged firm, SEEK would be prevented from entering into such exclusive agreements with employer and recruiter customers. By deterring exclusivity, the behavioural commitments aim to retain the current practice of multi-homing (i.e. utilising more than one online recruitment advertising service platform) by employers, recruiters and jobseekers. It further aims to keep barriers to entry and expansion low, and preserve competition in the market for online recruitment advertising services
b. To address the concern that the merged firm may impose price increases post-merger, SEEK will be required to maintain current pricing of its services capped at present day rate cards or current day negotiated prices, subject to CPI variations. This aims to address concerns identified by market participants that the closeness of competition between the parties is likely to cause a rise in prices post-merger
- The term of the behavioural commitments will be for a period of 3 years from the date of completion of the transaction, or the date of the decision, whichever is later. CCCS considers this term to properly take into account the dynamic nature of the market
- To ensure that the commitments are complied with, SEEK will appoint a Monitoring Trustee on terms and conditions agreed with the CCCS. This is in line with CCCS guidelines which provide that if commitments require monitoring, then parties must be prepared to meet the costs of engaging a monitoring trustee who will, e.g. have the task of submitting regular reports on compliance to CCCS

SEEK’s divestiture commitment from aggregator website
- CCCS received information that SEEK owns and operates the aggregator site jobs.com.sg in Singapore which was acquired in 2013, a site which aggregates recruitment advertisements listed on other online job portals. This information was not previously disclosed to CCCS by the parties during the merger assessment. CCCS considered this information to be material to its assessment and SEEK explained that the omission was inadvertent
- CCCS investigated the potential competition concerns which may arise from SEEK’s ownership of the aggregator website
- In response, SEEK proposed a divestiture commitment, where it will divest as a going concern the assets of jobs.com.sg, which include (i) the domain name and the website operated from that domain, and (ii) all rights, title and interest to use the technology used to crawl websites with job opportunities, received information on job opportunities via XML feeds and make such job opportunities searchable on the website for the sole purpose of providing products and services towards the Singapore recruitment market

Conclusion
- CCCS considered the behavioural commitments and divestiture commitment by SEEK to be sufficient to address the likely adverse effects arising from the transaction
- Thus, subject to the implementation and compliance with the commitments by SEEK, the transaction will not infringe s54 CA

Case study: Parkway/Radlink – s54 SLC
Summary
- Parkway Holdings planned to acquire the entire equity stake in Radlink (together with its subsidiaries) from Fortis Healthcare
* Radlink is a radio diagnostic imaging business only located in Singapore, which operates imaging centres, a small chain of GP clinics and a Cyclotron machine
* Parkway has a network of hospitals, primary care clinics, radiology and imaging service facilities and laboratories in Singapore. Parkway is a minority shareholder in Positron Tracers Pte Ltd which owns a Cyclotron machine in Singapore
- The overlapping goods and services in the transaction are: (a) radiology and imaging services, (b) primary care clinics and services, and (c) supply of radiopharmaceuticals
- CCCS took a provisional decision to BLOCK Parkway’s proposed acquisition of Radlink, as it would result in a SLC in the affected markets and would infringe s54 CA. The anticipated merger has been abandoned since.

Competition issues identified
- Supply of radiopharmaceuticals: post-merger, Parkway would become the only commercial supplier of radiopharmaceuticals in Singapore, through its 33% shareholding of Positron Tracers Pte Ltd (“PTPL”) and the acquisition of 100% of RadLink. CCS’s market inquiries indicated that no potential new radiopharmaceutical supplier would enter the market in the next two to three years to compete with the merged entity

- Provision of radiology and imaging services: in the provision of radiology and imaging services for private outpatients in Singapore, evidence suggests that Parkway and RadLink are each other’s closest competitors pre-merger. In addition, CCS notes that post-merger, the merged entity would have very substantial market share. Evidence also suggests that entry barriers are moderate to high, and the bargaining power of customers is weak

- Vertical effects: an SLC is also likely to arise from the vertical integration of the Parties’ operations between the supply of radiopharmaceuticals and provision of radiology and imaging services, as per the figure below. 
* The merged entity would be able to restrict competition in the market for radiology and imaging services by controlling the supply, the prices and/or the range of radiopharmaceuticals available to its downstream competitors


Case study: CCS Fines Capacitor Manufacturers Involved in Global Cartel for Price-fixing and Information Exchange – s34 CA
Summary
- CCCS issued an infringement decision against 5 capacitor manufacturers for engaging in anti-competitive agreements. The agreements include price-fixing and the exchange of confidential sales, distribution and pricing information for Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitors (“AECs”) in relation to customers in Singapore. 

- From at least 1997 to 2013, parties substituted the risks of price competition in favour of practical cooperation and thus their pricing strategies were not independently made. The parties, who were close competitors, held regular meetings in Singapore where they:
(i) exchanged confidential and commercially sensitive business information such as customer quotations, sales volumes, production capacities, business plans and pricing strategies; 
(ii) discussed and agreed on sales prices, including various price increases; and 
(iii) agreed to collectively reject customers’ requests for reduction in prices of AECs sold to them

- As each party contributed or intended to contribute to the common overall anti-competitive object to collude on pricing decisions, the parties were found to have participated in a single continuous infringement infringing s34 CA
* An infringement of the s34 prohibition may result not only from a single act but also from a series of acts or continuous conduct. Where it can be established that a set of individual agreements are interlinked in terms of pursuing the same object or as part of a plan, they can be characterised as constituting a single continuous infringement
* Passive participation can also infringe the s34 prohibition if the undertaking attends meetings without expressing disapproval or distancing itself from the cartel
* The fact that an undertaking did not take part in all aspects of the cartel scheme or played only a minor role in the aspects in which it participated is not material to the establishment of an infringement, although this might have an influence on the assessment of the extent of the liability and the severity of the penalty

- The parties’ object of an agreement or concerted practice is not based on the subjective intention of the parties when entering into an agreement, but rather on the *objective meaning and purpose of the agreement considered in the economic context in which it is to be applied

- Without the agreements, the parties would have been under greater competitive pressure. This means that an individual AEC supplier may not have been able to sustain a price increase without losing market share to its competitors as its customers could switch to another AEC supplier. Hence, without the cartel activity, the parties would have had to draw customers with better prices or quality of products

- The harm to competition was for a protracted period of time as this was a long-running cartel made up of the major suppliers of AECs in ASEAN, including Singapore. The parties have therefore committed a serious infringement

Case study: Fresh Chickens – s34 CA
On 4 December 2020, Singapore's Competition Appeal Board (CAB) reduced penalties imposed on eight out of thirteen distributors of fresh chicken found to have engaged in cartel conduct in September 2018.  The reduction in fines ranged from 20% to 70%.

What you need to know – key takeaways
* While trade associations exist to facilitate legitimate forms of interaction between industry participants, they also present a high risk environment for information sharing and anti-competitive coordination.
* Cartelists that are "passive" or "followers" are culpable for breaches of competition law, although having a passive or limited role in a cartel arrangement could be taken into account by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore ("CCCS") as a mitigating factor when determining fines.

Only four appeals were made to the CAB (although eight appellants were involved in the proceedings because the Lee Say Group consisted of five entities).  
A fifth appeal was filed by Kee Song Food Corporation ("Kee Song"), however this was dropped after Kee Song reached an agreement with the CCCS on the quantum of fine payable during an earlier stage of the hearing.  The remaining four parties to the CCCS's decision who did not file appeals were leniency applicants.

Substantively, the appeals were made not only in respect of the quantum of financial penalties but also against the CCCS's findings that the parties had participated in anticompetitive behaviour.

The first issue before the CAB was whether each of the appellants had infringed section 34 of the Competition Act through their participation in: 
* the Non-Aggression Pact ("NAP") – a market sharing agreement under which the appellants were alleged to have agreed not to compete for each other's customers; and
* Price Discussions – the subject matter of those discussions included agreements with respect to the quantum and timing of price movements in relation to the sale and distribution of fresh chickens (including via the exchange of price information and future pricing intentions).

Based on the evidence before it, the CAB found there was insufficient evidence to establish that seven of the eight appellants had participated in the NAP. In the case of the remaining appellant, one of its directors had admitted during CCCS's witness examination process that it had participated in the NAP. With respect to the Price Discussions, the CAB upheld the CCCS's finding of infringement against all eight appellants.

The second issue for the CAB to consider was the appropriate amount of any financial penalties.
 
The CAB took into account several factors in re-assessing the  penalties to be imposed on each of the appellants.  Notably, the CAB corrected the CCCS's earlier proposition that a "mere passive or follower role" is not a mitigating factor.  Having regard to the CCCS Guidelines on the Appropriate Amount of Penalty in Competition Cases 2016, the CAB held that a passive and limited role could amount to mitigating circumstances, and applied this principle in its re-assessment of penalties.
