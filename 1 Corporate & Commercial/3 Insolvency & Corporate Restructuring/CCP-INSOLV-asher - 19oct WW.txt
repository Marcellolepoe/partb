LIQUIDATION
1. Short header - Case name [2020] SGHC 3939
a) CA s 139
b) Lorem ipsum emphasis lorem ipsum underline also works.
c) For very emphasis or inline annotations [like this]

2. Focus of liquidation topic:
a) Compulsory liquidation
b) Creditor’s right to place company under liquidation.
c) Winding up process.
d) Issues arising in liquidation administration.

3. Types of Winding Up Proceedings
a) Compulsory Winding up (CWU), i.e. by the court – s 124 and generally, IRDA Part 8 Division 2.
i)  On application by permitted persons.

b) Voluntary Winding up – s 160 and generally, IRDA Part 8 Division 3
i) This is only initiated *by the company itself.

ii) Company (shareholders) passes a resolution to wind up
(1) For voluntary winding up, a *special resolution has to be passed; supermajority (at least 75%) is required for winding up. This is because the members are voluntarily winding up the company.
(2) In any case where, before the making of a winding up application, a resolution has been passed by the company for voluntary winding up, the winding up of the company is deemed to have commenced AT THE TIME OF PASSING OF THE RESOLUTION (s 126(1)(a) IRDA)
(3) Unless on proof of fraud or mistake, all proceedings in the voluntary winding up are deemed to have been validly taken (s 126(1)(b) IRDA)
(4) In any other case, the winding up is deemed to have commenced AT THE TIME OF MAKING OF THE APPLICATION FOR WINDING UP (s 126(2) IRDA)

iii) Creditor’s or Member’s Winding Up – who controls the process?
(1) Member’s Voluntary Winding Up (MVL) – when company is solvent (more assets to meet liabilities, but members want to wind up). (s 164-165)

(2) Creditor’s Voluntary Winding Up (CVL) – when company is insolvent, and creditors would have the right to choose the liquidator at a creditor’s meeting. (s 166-170)



1.1 *Winding up by the court (s 124 IRDA)
4. Court’s Jurisdiction to wind up a Company (locus standi) – s 124. 
a) A company, whether or not it is under voluntary liquidation, may be wound up under a court order on the application of a *creditor (among other people like directors, shareholders, liquidators or judicial manager).

b) 3 broad elements
i) Applicant must have locus standi to apply for an order (list in s 124(1) IRDA)
(1) Focus is on creditors under s 124(1)(c) IRDA
(2) Creditor includes a “prospective or contingent creditor”, a person towards whom under an existing obligation, the company may or will become subject to a present liability to pay a sum of money on the happening of some future event or at some future date (Re People’s Parkway Development Pte Ltd)

ii) Statutory ground for winding up (list in s 125(1) IRDA)
(1) Mainly, the inability to pay debts under s 125(1)(e) IRDA.

iii) Persuade the court to exercise discretion in winding up the company --> COURT HAS DISCRETION TO DECLINE TO GRANT WINDING UP ORDER
(1) Court can refuse to make order for public policy reasons (BNP Paribas)
(2) Court may dismiss the winding up application, but must not refuse to make a winding up order on the ground only that (s 128(1) IRDA): --> i.e. winding up order can still be made even in these circumstances
(a) the assets of the company have been mortgaged to an amount equal to or in excess of those assets;
(b) the company has no assets; or
(c) in the case of an application by a contributory, there will be no assets available for distribution amongst the contributories.
 
5. Procedure - Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Corporate Insolvency and Restructuring) Rules 2020.
a) Application to be made by originating application supported by Affidavit (r 8, IRD(CIR)R)
i) Application for winding up order should be made by Form CIR-11 (application by company) or Form CIR-12 (application by person other than company) (r 63, IRD(CIR)R [r 22, CWUR]), and be accompanied by a supporting affidavit (r 67, IRD(CIR)R [r 25, CWUR]).
b) Advertise winding up 7 clear days before the hearing, at least once in the Gazette, and once at least in one English and one Chinese local daily newspaper or in such other newspapers as the Court may direct (r 66, IRD(CIR)R [r 24, CWUR]) and file a memorandum of advertisement under Form CIR-2 (r 39, IRD(CIR)R [r 20, CWUR]).

ii) Applicant is to prepare list of persons intending to appear in accordance with Form CIR-16 (r 71, IRD(CIR)R [r 29, CWUR]).
1.1.1 *Grounds for Winding Up: Inability to pay debts (s125(1)(e) IRDA; s254(1)(e) CA)
6. Overview
a) Most commonly used ground when applying for winding up by the court
b) 3 ways to establish inability to pay debts – s 125(2) IRDA.
i) Failure to meet statutory demand – (s 125(2)(a) IRDA; s 254(2)(a) CA)
ii) Execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of any court in favour of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part – (s 125(2)(b) IRDA; s 254(2)(b) CA);
iii) Proved that the Company is unable to pay its debts, to the satisfaction of the Court – (s 125(2)(c) IRDA; s 254(2)(c) CA)

7. Statutory Demand
a) Requirements under s 125(2)(a)
i) indebted in a sum exceeding $15,000 then due,
ii) creditor has served on the company, by leaving at the registered office, a written demand requiring the company to pay the sum so due, and 
iii) the company has for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor.
b) Procedure – in BNP Paribas at [5]
i) to prove a deemed inability using a statutory demand, it is necessary for the creditor to have a “due” debt, which the debtor has for three weeks neglected to pay or to secure or compound to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor
ii) If security is given but the creditor claims the security is not satisfactory and is determined to issue winding-up proceedings, the debtor may then apply to court for a restraining order so as to enable the court to determine on an objective basis what the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor should be
c) The word ‘neglect’ in the provision suggests some element of fault. There is no neglect if debt is bona fide disputed. (Ng Tai Tuan v Chng Gim Huat Pte Ltd)

8. Court satisfied that the company is unable to pay its debts – s 125(2)(c)
a) Contingent & prospective liabilities: court will take into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company. 
i) BNY Corporate Trustee Services v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 – Court should be careful of how it values these liabilities given that they are distant (in the future) and are not certain (contingent); hence, the more distant they are, the harder it will be to establish them 
ii) Careful when considering debts in a foreign currency due to forex fluctuations.

b) **Current SG Test for insolvency: Cash flow test – Sun Electric Power Pte Ltd v RCMA Asia Pte Ltd [2021] SGCA 60: 
i) General principle: *Whether the company’s current assets exceed its current liabilities, such that it is able to meet all debts as and when they fall due within a 12-month timeframe

ii) “the court is allowed to consider the company’s contingent and prospective liabilities, and not merely current liabilities, as these would affect whether the company could pay its debts as and when they became due.” (at [59]) 
(1) But this is not the same as balance sheet test. The words “contingent and prospective liabilities” import futurity, not the balance sheet test.

iii) Current assets and current liabilities “refer to assets which will be realisable and debts which will fall due within a 12-month timeframe.” (at [65]) The test “does not require the debts to be already due or demanded, nor does it require the assets to be immediately available.” (at [66]) --> i.e. can consider debts which fall due in the next 12 months, and any assets which can also be realised within the next 12 months

iv) The test is whether the company’s assets were realisable within a timeframe that would allow each of the debts to be paid as and when it became payable, and whether the liquidity problem can be cured in the reasonably near future. The court should also consider debts which may not have been demanded, and which may not even be due 

v) [69] set out a non-exhaustive list to be considered:
(1) the quantum of all debts which are due or will be due in the reasonably near future;
(2) whether payment is being demanded or is likely to be demanded for those debts;
(3) whether the company has failed to pay any of its debts, the quantum of such debt, and for how long the company has failed to pay it;
(4) the length of time which has passed since the commencement of the winding-up proceedings;
(5) the value of the company’s current assets and assets which will be realisable in the reasonably near future;
(6) the state of the company’s business, in order to determine its expected net cash flow from the business by deducting from projected future sales the cash expenses which would be necessary to generate those sales;
(7) any other income or payment which the company may receive in the reasonably near future; and
(8) arrangements between the company and prospective lenders, such as its bankers and shareholders, in order to determine whether any shortfall in liquid and realisable assets and cash flow could be made up by borrowings which would be repayable at a time later than the debts.
1.1.2 *Presumption of Insolvency
9. Overview
a) Satisfaction of one of the 3 grounds in s 125(2) IRDA will result in the company to be deemed insolvent.
b) Q – how strictly must the requirements in s 125(2) be followed?

10. Strict compliance required – BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard 
a) Not insolvent if the debtor company did not neglect to secure the debt as demanded.
b) Important for the statutory demand to state that the debtor company has 3 options: to pay the debt, to secure the debt, or compound for the debt to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor. If not, the statutory demand is at risk of being challenged (by the debtor company) on the basis of irregularity, which can compromise any potential winding up application which may be filed against the company by a creditor 
c) Hence, the statutory demand may be satisfied by a method other than payment (i.e. debtor can satisfy the statutory demand other than paying the debt). The debtor in this case offered to fully secure the debt by placing the amount in escrow; this was sufficient. 
d) Omitting the 3 options from the demand – pay, secure, compound – would undermine the validity of the statutory demand (at [14])

NB s 125(2)(a) IRDA: a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding $15,000 then due has served on the company, by leaving at the registered office of the company, a written demand by the creditor or the creditor’s lawfully authorised agent requiring the company to pay the sum so due, and the company has for 3 weeks after the service of the demand neglected to pay the sum, or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor 

--> *i.e. debtor has 3 choices to respond to the creditor’s statutory demand. If creditor does not allow debtor to go through the 2 other means, the statutory demand may be challenged and any winding up application filed by the creditor may fail

Facts: On 20 November 2007, JSPL offered to place in escrow sufficient funds to cover the US$50m to meet any judgment obtained by BNP on its claim. This was made on the condition that BNP commence legal proceedings to recover the alleged debt. JSPL gave BNP up to 23 November 2007 to consider the offer. BNP rejected the escrow offer and served a statutory demand to JSPL for payment that same day.

On 23 November 2007, JSPL applied to the High Court for an injunction to restrain BNP from commencing winding-up proceedings on the ground that there were triable issues to BNP’s claim and that BNP was not entitled to present a winding up petition.

CA held that BNP should have accepted JSPL’s offer to pay the amount of the crystallized loss into an escrow account and thereafter commenced an action against JSPL to recover the alleged debt. We hold that in a case where a solvent company does not admit the debt and is prepared to offer security to defend the claim, the court should not as a matter of principle, in the exercise of its discretion, allow a claimant to file a winding up petition against the solvent company, with all the potentially disastrous consequences that may result from the filing of the petition. It is inappropriate to use the threat of winding up to force a company to pay the unadmitted debt, in such circumstances.
1.1.3 *Disputing a debt
11. Disputing a debt on substantial grounds – s 128
a) Debt may be disputed on substantive grounds or challenge where company has a bona fide cross-claim of substance. 
b) If so, the company may seek to stay or dismiss a winding up application or file an injunction pre-emptively to prevent the creditor from proceeding to file a winding up application.
i) Burden of proof for this is only at the level of resisting a summary judgment – debtor only needs to raise triable issues to obtain stay or dismissal of winding up application
ii) Example in BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard – there was no legal basis whatsoever for BNP to threaten to file a winding-up petition against JSPL. JSPL was not an insolvent company and BNP ought to have commenced court proceedings instead, as it is settled law that the court’s winding-up jurisdiction is not for the purpose of deciding a disputed debt
iii) Until a creditor is established as a creditor (after showing that debtor company is insolvent and unable to pay), he is not entitled to present the petition and has no locus standi

12. Principles
a) where the debt is disputed on substantial grounds, the Court may restrain the winding up application or order a stay or dismissal of winding up proceedings “on the ground that the locus standi of the petitioner as a creditor is in question, and it is an abuse of process of the court for the petitioner to try to enforce a disputed debt in this way.” (Metalform Asia). 

b) In cases where debt is UNDISPUTED, the court would ordinarily direct that the company be wound up.

c) The **test for a disputed debt is whether there are triable issues to be heard, such that the debtor is not required to prove that the debt was not owed. 
i) “the debtor need only raise triable issues in order to obtain a stay or a dismissal of bankruptcy proceedings.” (Chimbusco International Petroleum). 

d) Rationale: Winding up application is not the appropriate avenue for determining debt liabilities or for pressuring the debtor for payment, and any attempt to do so would be an abuse of the court resulting in the action being struck out (BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd [2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 at [11]; Metalform Asia v Holland Leedon at [62]).
i) In Chimbusco International, the debt was disputed on grounds that the guarantees were obtained by misrepresentation. The Court granted a stay of winding up application. 
ii) In Metalform Asia, the debtor contested that they had a cross-claim** that would exceed the amount of debt owed. This was a substantial ground; hence, the Court granted an injunction to restrain the creditor at the presentation of winding up application, rather than by refusing to make a winding up order at the hearing of the application. 
(1) Public policy consideration of creditors threatening companies with winding up.
(2) Related to Court’s discretion.
(3) ** in cases of cross claims – a genuine and serious cross claim throws locus standi into question too
1.1.4 *Court’s Discretion
13. Court’s Discretion
a) Court has wide discretion under IRDA s 128 to consider various factors. 
b) “have regard to the wishes of creditors or contributories” of the company (s 201(1)(a), IRDA) and may “direct meetings of creditors or contributories to be called, held and conducted” to ascertain those wishes (s 201(1)(b), IRDA), including those who oppose the winding up application. In doing so, the Court may account for the value of the creditors’ debts, whether they are secured creditors, and whether they are the majority in number and value (Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG v Continental Chemical Corp Pte Ltd [2010] 3 SLR 76 at [9]). 
c) Have regard of public interests and those of the employees and trade partners of the company, **especially if the company is only temporarily insolvent but otherwise is commercially viable: BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd [2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 (CA) 
i) [19]: “Where a petition to wind up a temporarily insolvent but commercially viable company is filed, many other economic and social interests may be affected, such as those of its employees, the non- petitioning creditors, as well as the company’s suppliers, customers and shareholders.” These interests can be taken into account
ii) [21]: “as a matter of principle, the court should not, in the exercise of its discretion, allow a claimant to file a winding-up petition against a solvent company.”
(1) Means if offer of security for debt given, then there are no grounds for a winding up petition to be sustained on.

1.2 *Voluntary winding up
14. The voluntary winding up process is an out-of-court process, that is why there are no equivalent grounds for winding up or factors that the court would consider before granting the winding up order (unlike court winding up above).

15. NB main difference between MVWU and CVWU: --> thus not about which process is more advantageous, but consider mainly the financial state of the company at the material time
a) MVWU is subject to there being a declaration of solvency by the directors (s 163 IRDA), i.e. that the company can still pay its debts within 12 months after the date of commencement of winding up but not after
b) CVWU is where the directors lodge a declaration that the company CANNOT continue its business by reason of its liabilities.

16. Overview of voluntary winding up, (1) members’ VWU (s 160-165 IRDA) and (2) creditors’ VWU (s 160-163, 166-170 IRDA):

S 160(1) IRDA: A company may be wound up voluntarily —
(a) when the period (if any) fixed for the duration of the company by the constitution of the company expires or, where the constitution of the company provides that the company is to be dissolved on the occurrence of an event, when that event happens, and the company in general meeting has passed a resolution requiring the company to be wound up voluntarily; or
(b) if the company so resolves by special resolution.

S 161(1) IRDA: Where the directors of a company have made and lodged with the Official Receiver a statutory declaration in the prescribed form, and have lodged a declaration in the prescribed form with the Registrar of Companies —
(a) that the company cannot by reason of its liabilities continue its business; and
(b) that meetings of the company and of its creditors have been summoned for a date within 30 days after the date of the declaration,
the directors must immediately appoint a licensed insolvency practitioner to be the provisional liquidator.

S 161(6) IRDA: A voluntary winding up commences —
(a) where a provisional liquidator has been appointed before the resolution for voluntary winding up was passed, at the time when the declaration mentioned in subsection (1) was lodged with the Registrar of Companies; or
(b) in any other case, at the time of the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up.

S 162 IRDA: EFFECTS OF VOLUNTARY WINDING UP
(1) The company must, starting on the commencement of the winding up, cease to carry on its business, except so far as is in the opinion of the liquidator required for the beneficial winding up of the company.
(2)  Despite anything to the contrary in the constitution of the company, the corporate state and corporate powers of the company continue until the company is dissolved.
(3)  Any transfer of shares, not being a transfer made to or with the sanction of the liquidator, and any alteration in the status of the members made after the commencement of the winding up, are void
1.2.1 MVWU (where company is solvent but members decide to wind up):
S 163(1) IRDA: DECLARATION OF SOLVENCY BY DIRECTORS (for MVWU only) – Where it is proposed to wind up a company voluntarily pursuant to a members’ voluntary winding up, the directors of the company or, in the case of a company that has more than 2 directors, the majority of the directors must, before the date on which the notices of the meeting at which the resolution for the winding up of the company is to be proposed are sent out, make a declaration to the effect that —
(a) they have made an inquiry into the affairs of the company; and
(b) at a meeting of directors, they have formed the opinion that the company will be able to pay its debts in full within a period not exceeding 12 months after the commencement of the winding up.

S 164(1) IRDA: company in general meeting must appoint one or more liquidators for the purpose of winding up the affairs and distributing the assets of the company, and may fix the remuneration to be paid to the liquidator or liquidators.
(2)  On the appointment of a liquidator, all the powers of the directors cease except so far as the liquidator, or the company in general meeting with the consent of the liquidator, approves the continuance of those powers.

If company undergoing MVWU turns out to be insolvent instead: --> conversion from MVWU to CVWU
S 165(1) IRDA: If the liquidator is at any time of the opinion that the company will not be able to pay or provide for the payment of its debts in full within the period stated in the declaration made under section 163(1), the liquidator must immediately summon a meeting of the creditors and lay before the meeting a statement of the assets and liabilities of the company.
(5)  The creditors may, at the meeting summoned under subsection (1), appoint a person to be the liquidator for the purpose of winding up the affairs and distributing the assets of the company in place of the liquidator appointed by the company. --> CREDITORS CAN APPOINT THEIR OWN LIQUIDATOR, INSTEAD OF THE ONE ALREADY APPOINTED
(6)  If the creditors appoint a person under subsection (5), the winding up is to proceed after the appointment as if the winding up were a creditors’ voluntary winding up.
(7)  Within 7 days after a meeting has been held under subsection (1), the liquidator or, if some other person has been appointed by the creditors to be the liquidator, the person so appointed must lodge with the Registrar of Companies and with the Official Receiver a notice in the prescribed form… and if default there is criminal liability
(8)  Where the liquidator has convened a meeting under subsection (1) and the creditors do not appoint a person to be the liquidator in place of the liquidator appointed by the company —
a. the winding up is to proceed after the meeting as if the winding up were a creditors’ voluntary winding up; but
b. the liquidator is not required to summon an annual meeting of creditors at the end of the first year after the commencement of the winding up, if the meeting held under subsection (1) was held less than 3 months before the end of that year.
1.2.2 CVWU (where company is insolvent, usually initiated by directors with concurrence of members): --> NEED TO SUMMON MEETING OF CREDITORS in addition to meeting to pass special resolution by members
S 166(1) IRDA: The company must cause a meeting of the creditors of the company to be summoned for the day, or the day next following the day, on which there is to be held the meeting of the company at which the resolution for voluntary winding up is to be proposed, and must cause the notices of the meeting of creditors to be sent to the creditors simultaneously with the sending of the notices of the meeting of the company.
(2)  The company must convene the meeting of the creditors at a time and place convenient to the majority in value of the creditors, and must —
a. send notice of the meeting to the creditors at least 10 days before the date of the meeting; and
b. send to each creditor, with the notice, a statement showing the names of all creditors and the amounts of their claims.
(3)  The company must cause notice of the meeting of the creditors to be advertised at least 7 days before the date of the meeting in the Gazette and at least one English local daily newspaper.
(4)  The directors of the company must —
a. cause a full statement of the company’s affairs showing in respect of assets the method and manner in which the valuation of the assets was arrived at, together with a list of the creditors and the estimated amount of their claims to be laid before the meeting of the creditors; and
b. appoint one of their number to attend the meeting.

S 167(1) IRDA: The company must, and the creditors may at their respective meetings, nominate a person to be liquidator for the purpose of winding up the affairs and distributing the assets of the company, and if the creditors and the company nominate different persons, the person nominated by the creditors is to be liquidator, and if no person is nominated by the creditors, the person nominated by the company is to be liquidator.
(4) On the appointment of a liquidator, all the powers of the directors cease, except so far as the committee of inspection or, if there is no such committee, the creditors approve the continuance of those powers.

S 168(1) IRDA: The liquidator may require any director who has not made the statement of affairs mentioned in section 166(4) to submit a statement of concurrence verified by affidavit, stating that that director concurs in the statement of affairs.

S 169(1) IRDA: COMMITTEE OF INSPECTION – The creditors at the meeting summoned under section 165(1) or 166(1) or at any subsequent meeting may, if they think fit, appoint a committee of inspection consisting of not more than 5 persons, whether creditors or not, and if such a committee is appointed, the company may, either at the meeting at which the resolution for voluntary winding up is passed or at any time subsequently in general meeting, appoint such number of persons (but not more than 5) as the company thinks fit to act as members of the committee.

S 170(1) IRDA: Any attachment, sequestration, distress or execution put in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of a creditors’ voluntary winding up is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.
(2) After the commencement of the winding up, no action or proceeding may be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose.

17. Conversion from voluntary to compulsory winding up
a) S 124(1) – creditor can apply for compulsory winding even if voluntary winding up in process.
b) S 124(2)(e) – To do so, the liquidator or creditor must convince the court that a voluntary winding up cannot be continued with due regard to the interests of creditors and shareholders
c) Conditions – Korea Asset Management 
i) the court may grant a winding up order if (a) it would benefit the creditors or shareholders or (b) if it is the general wish of the creditors to do so
ii) In deciding whether to grant the order, the court can consider:
(1) Whether the applicant creditor is attempting to gain an advantage from the application. 
(2) Whether the claims of other creditors would be prejudiced. 
(3) If the company’s resources could afford the additional costs. 
(4) If the current liquidator appears to be related to the directors. 
iii) Overall aim of liquidation is to extract the largest amount and distribute it to creditors. 
d) S 126(1)(b) – If this is done, all proceedings already taken in the voluntary winding up are deemed to be valid unless fraud or mistake is proven

1.3 *Effect of winding up
18. Effect of Winding Up APPLICATION
a) Timing – 
i) s 126: for compulsory court winding up, winding up deemed to have commenced
(1) when application has been made.
(2) BUT if there were voluntary winding up resolutions passed before the application was made, time is when resolution was passed, and those actions are valid. 
ii) S 161(6) – Voluntary winding up commences
(1) When provisional liquidator appointed, or 
(2) When resolution for voluntary winding up is passed. --> i.e. special resolution

b) *Moratorium on legal and enforcement proceedings – 

i) For court winding up – S 129 IRDA: after WU application and before a WU order, Company or any creditor or contributory may apply to stay further proceedings against the Company: (S 258 of the Companies Act)

No disposition of Company Property:
(1) s 130(1):  Any disposition of the property of the company, including things in action, and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of the members of the company, made after the commencement of the winding up by the Court is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.
(2) s 130(2): Any attachment, sequestration, distress or execution put in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up by the Court is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.

*S 133(1) IRDA: When a winding up order has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed, no action or proceeding may be proceeded with or commenced against the company except —
(a)	by the leave of the Court; and
(b)	in accordance with such terms as the Court may impose.

ii) For creditors’ voluntary winding up – s 170(2) IRDA: “After the commencement of the winding up, no action or proceeding may be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose.”
(1) Note – for VWU, ‘commenced’ when special resolution has been passed.

S 162(1) IRDA: The company must, starting on the commencement of the winding up, cease to carry on its business, except so far as is in the opinion of the liquidator required for the beneficial winding up of the company.
(2)  Despite anything to the contrary in the constitution of the company, the corporate state and corporate powers of the company continue until the company is dissolved.
(3)  Any transfer of shares, not being a transfer made to or with the sanction of the liquidator, and any alteration in the status of the members made after the commencement of the winding up, are void.

iii) Restriction on creditor’s rights of execution/attachment – s 206: Creditor cannot enforce such rights against a company being wound up, UNLESS the creditor has completed the execution or attachment before the date of the commencement of the winding up. Note that:
(1) If creditor has notice of a meeting for proposing resolution for voluntary winding up, the notice date = date of the commencement of the winding up
(2) a person, who purchases in good faith under a sale by the bailiff any goods of the company on which an execution has been levied, acquires in all cases a good title to the goods against the liquidator; and
(3) the rights conferred by this subsection on the liquidator may be set aside by the Court in favour of the creditor as the Court thinks fit.
  
19. Effect of Winding Up ORDER
a) No action or proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except with the leave of Court and in accordance with such terms as the Court imposes: s 133 (s 262(3) of the Companies Act).
b) Creditors cannot take the benefit of uncompleted execution: s 206 (s 334 of the Companies Act). --> e.g. a pending garnishee order, rationale is to preserve the assets of the company for the general body of creditors where possible (all claims should be dealt with in the context of the winding up)
c) For compulsory winding up – s 133(1): “When a winding up order has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed, no action or proceeding may be proceeded with or commenced against the company except — (a) by the leave of the Court; and (b) in accordance with such terms as the Court may impose.”

20. Principles wrt Court granting leave to commence or continue proceedings
a) Court is generally wary of granting leave to commence proceedings.
b) Korea Asset Management v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd [2004] 1 SLR 671 – factors to consider: 
Reasons for Granting LeaveReasons Against Granting Leave? The applicant is merely attempting to claim property which prima facie belongs to the applicant from the company ([49])
? “when the liability of the creditor needs to be a liquidated amount before it is admitted to proof” ([50])
? “if third party rights against a company have crystallised before winding up commences, then the company’s rights against the insurers will be vested in the third party.” ([49])
? Seeking a benefit not otherwise available to it through the conventional winding up procedure ([48])
? Claims of other legitimate creditors will be prejudiced “in a manner that could be viewed as negating the statutory scheme of pari passu treatment for all unsecured creditors” ([48])
? “no likelihood of claim being satisfied in any way” ([48])
? claim being pursued can be adequately or conveniently dealt with within the insolvency regime ([48])
? “company’s resources are threadbare and considerable costs would be incurred if leave were granted.” ([50])

1.4 Powers of the Liquidator
Once a winding up order is made, the Company’s board of directors ceases to have executive function and becomes functus officio.

The power and duty of running the company falls to the Official Receiver (with his consent) or private liquidator (where one is appointed).

Summary: the liquidator/Official Receiver 
* Is appointed by the Court
* Is an officer of the Court
* Owes fiduciary duties to the company and its creditors
* Must be independent
* Must act fairly
* Is entitled to remuneration
* Duty to liquidate the company’s assets and apply the proceeds towards the discharge of the company’s debts and liabilities
* Liquidator will rely on Statement of Affairs filed under s141 IRDA and s270 CA – SOA sets out assets and liabilities of the company and details of the company’s affairs
* Liquidator may apply to Court for a person who has knowledge of the company’s affairs to be examined (s244 IRDA and s285 CA)

21. Appointment of Liquidator 
a) s 135(1): “when making a winding up application, the applicant must nominate in writing a licensed insolvency practitioner to be appointed liquidator.”
b) Official Receiver may be appointed as the liquidator? – ss 135(3), 135(4)
i) s 135(3): “The applicant may nominate the Official Receiver to be appointed as liquidator if — (a) the applicant has taken reasonable steps, but is unable, to obtain the consent of a licensed insolvency practitioner to be appointed as liquidator; and (b) the Official Receiver consents to being nominated to be appointed as liquidator.

22. General
a) s 139:
i) s 139(1) A liquidator appointed by the Court may resign or on cause shown be removed by the Court.
ii) S 139(2)  A provisional liquidator, other than the Official Receiver, is entitled to receive remuneration by way of percentage or otherwise as is determined by the Court.
b) s 140(1): Where a winding up order has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed, the liquidator or provisional liquidator must take into his or her custody or under his or her control all the property and things in action to which the company is or appears to be entitled.
i) But NO vesting of the company’s assets in the liquidator – see s 140(2), IRDA
c) s 144: States the powers of the liquidator – wide ranging powers, from paying any class of creditors
i) Note s 144(1)(a): The liquidator may, after authorisation by either the Court or the committee of inspection carry on the business of the company so far as is necessary for the beneficial winding up of the company, but such authorisation is not necessary to so carry on the business of the company during the 4 weeks immediately after the date of the winding up order
d) Limit – s 144(3): The exercise by the liquidator of the powers conferred by this section is subject to the control of the Court, and any creditor or contributory may apply to the Court with respect to any exercise or proposed exercise of any of those powers.
e) s 177: Powers of liquidator for voluntary winding up

23. Other (less important) provisions
a) s 178: Power of liquidator on sale of company to another corporation
b) s 181(1): Liquidator may apply to Court to – (a) to determine any question arising in the winding up of a company; or (b) to exercise all or any of the powers that the Court might exercise if the company were being wound up by the Court.
c) s 244: Liquidator (s 244(2)) may apply to court for a person who has knowledge of the company’s affairs to be examined (s 244(1))
d) s 188(1): Every liquidator must keep proper books in which the liquidator must cause to be made entries or minutes of proceedings at meetings and of such other matters as are prescribed, and any creditor or contributory may, subject to the control of the Court, personally or by his or her agent inspect the books.
i) S 188(2): Court can inquire into liquidator’s actions if liquidator does not faithfully perform the liquidator’s duties and observe the prescribed requirements or the requirements of the Court, or Court receives complain
e) s 190: Any person aggrieved by any act or decision of the liquidator may apply to the Court, which may confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision complained of and make such order as the Court thinks just.
f) Liquidator owes fiduciary duties to the company and its creditors and must be independent and act fairly regardless of who appointed them
 
24. Liquidator CANNOT pay out money unilaterally – Nova Leisure v Dynasty Theatre [2005] 
a) The court did not have the power to authorise a liquidator to pay money out of a bank account unilaterally. 
b) Rule 154(2), Companies (Winding Up) Rules provided that all payments made out of any account other than the Companies Liquidation Account had to be countersigned by at least one member of the committee of inspection (at [13]). Section 274(1) of the Companies Act and r 153(1) of the Rules did not override this requirement, as they only gave the court power to authorise the payment of money into a bank account, “not […] operation of a bank account.” ([15]) 
 
25. Dissolution and discharge of the liquidator – s 147, s 148, s 149
Release of liquidators and dissolution of company 
147.  When the liquidator —
(a)has realised all the property of the company, or so much of the property of the company as can in the liquidator’s opinion be realised, without needlessly protracting the liquidation, and has distributed a final dividend, if any, to the creditors and adjusted the rights of the contributories among themselves and made a final return, if any, to the contributories; or(b)has resigned or has been removed from office,
the liquidator may apply to the Court —
(c)for an order that the liquidator be released; or(d)for an order that the liquidator be released and that the company be dissolved.
Final account and dissolution
148.—(1)  Before a liquidator makes an application to the Court under section 147, the liquidator must call a meeting of the company and the creditors for the purpose of laying before them an account showing how the winding up has been conducted and the property of the company has been disposed of and giving any explanation of the account.
(2)  The meeting must be called by an advertisement, published in the Gazette and at least one English local daily newspaper —
(a)which must specify the time, place and object of the meeting;(b)which must be published at least 30 days before the meeting; and(c)a copy of which must be sent to the Official Receiver within 7 days after the publication of the advertisement.
(3)  The liquidator must within 7 days after the meeting lodge with the Registrar of Companies and the Official Receiver a return of the holding of the meeting and of its date, with a copy of the account attached to that return.
(4)  Any liquidator who fails to comply with subsection (3) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and also to a default penalty.
(5)  The quorum at the meeting of the company and the creditors is 2 members and 2 creditors.
(6)  If a quorum is not present at the meeting, the liquidator must (in lieu of the return mentioned in subsection (3)) lodge a return (with a copy of the account attached) that —
(a)the meeting was duly summoned; and(b)no quorum was present at the meeting.
(7)  Upon the lodgment of a return under subsection (6), the requirement to lodge a return under subsection (3) is deemed to have been complied with.

As to orders for release or dissolution
149.—(1)  Where an order is made that the company be dissolved, the company is from the date of the order dissolved.
(2)  The Court —
(a)may cause a report on the accounts of a liquidator, not being the Official Receiver, to be prepared by the Official Receiver or by a public accountant appointed by the Court;(b)must take into consideration the report and any objection which is urged by the Official Receiver, auditor or any creditor or contributory or other person interested against the release of the liquidator; and(c)must either grant or withhold the release of the liquidator accordingly.
(3)  Where the release of a liquidator is withheld, the Court may, on the application of any creditor or contributory or person interested, make such order as the Court thinks just charging the liquidator with the consequences of any act or default which the liquidator may have done or made contrary to the liquidator’s duty.
(4)  An order of the Court releasing the liquidator discharges the liquidator from all liability in respect of any act done or default made by the liquidator in the administration of the affairs of the company or otherwise in relation to his or her conduct as liquidator, but any such order may be revoked on proof that the order was obtained by fraud or by suppression or concealment of any material fact.
(5)  Where the liquidator has not previously resigned or been removed, his or her release operates as a removal from office.
(6)  Where the Court has made an order —
(a)that the liquidator be released; or(b)that the liquidator be released and that the company be dissolved,
a copy of the order must, within 14 days after the making of the order, be lodged by the liquidator with the Registrar of Companies and with the Official Receiver, respectively, and a liquidator who defaults in complying with the requirements of this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and also to a default penalty. 
Nevertheless, the Court may declare the dissolution of the company void at any time within 2 years after the date of the dissolution (i.e. the company in effect would still be alive) (s208 IRDA). 
--> e.g. where liquidator might not have fully dealt with all claims pending against the company prior to dissolution 

1.5 *Claims against the company
26. Provable debts – s 218 IRDA.
Description of debts provable in judicial management or winding up
218.—(1)  Subject to this section, the following are provable where a company other than an insolvent company is being wound up: --> SOLVENT COMPANY BEING WOUND UP
(a)any debt or liability to which the company —
(i)is subject at the commencement of the winding up; or(ii)may become subject after the commencement of the winding up;(b)any interest payable by the company on any debt or liability mentioned in paragraph (a).
(2)  Subject to this section and section 203, the following are provable where a company is in judicial management or an insolvent company is being wound up: --> INSOLVENT COMPANY BEING WOUND UP
(a)any debt or liability to which the company —
(i)is subject at the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be; or(ii)may become subject after the commencement of the judicial management or winding up (as the case may be) by reason of any obligation incurred before the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be;(b)any interest, on any debt or liability mentioned in paragraph (a), that is payable by the company in respect of any period before the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be.
(3)  Demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise, breach of trust, tort or bailment, or an obligation to make restitution, are not provable in the judicial management or insolvent winding up of a company. 
--> I.E. UNLIQUIDATED DAMAGES (not predetermined, to be assessed) BY REASON OF CONTRACT, PROMISE, BREACH OF TRUST, TORT OR BAILMENT OR AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE RESTITUTION ARE PROVABLE DEBTS
(4)  An estimate is to be made by the judicial manager or liquidator of the value of any debt or liability provable under this section that, by reason of its being subject to any contingency or contingencies, or for any other reason, does not bear a certain value.
(5)  Any person aggrieved by any such estimate by the judicial manager or liquidator may appeal to the Court.
(6)  If in the opinion of the Court the value of the debt or liability cannot be fairly estimated, the Court may make an order to that effect, and upon the making of that order the debt or liability is, for the purposes of this Act, deemed to be a debt not provable in the judicial management or winding up of the company.
(7)  If in the opinion of the Court the value of the debt or liability can be fairly estimated, the Court may assess the value of the debt or liability and may give all necessary directions for the purpose of valuing the debt or liability, and the amount of the value when assessed is deemed to be a debt provable in the judicial management or winding up of the company.
(8)  An amount payable under any order made by a court under any written law relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime is provable in the judicial management or winding up of a company.
a) Note the timing of commencement of winding up. Differs for compulsory/voluntary.

27. What happens if there are insufficient assets to pay everyone?
a) Distribution in equal proportions
b) Residue is divisible among the members in accordance with the Memorandum & Articles of Association / Constitution of the Company

28. On liquidators examining proof of debt – Fustar Chemicals Ltd (Hong Kong) v Liquidator of Fustar Chemicals Pte Ltd [2009] 4 SLR(R) 458 
a) Facts: There was a running account that the Company’s directors and shareholders unequivocally accepted as correct between  1988 and 2000. Q is whether the Liquidator should have accepted the proof of debt as documents tendered without more.
b) Liquidator has duties and powers
i) Duty to ensure assets distributed correctly
ii) Extensive powers to go behind documents – not bound by a company’s audited accounts or its audit confirmations
iii) BUT should only scrutinise a proof of debt on basis that it could be a false claim i.e. when there are reasons to be suspicious of it.
iv) Level of scrutiny for proof of debt depends on the circumstances.
c) Threshold for rejection of proof: A proof of debt should not be lightly rejected if the debt was consistently acknowledged in the company’s books; the liquidator “must have a reasonable basis on which to query a debt that appears to be genuine.” (at [20]). 
d) Note that unliquidated damages per s 218(3), IRDA [s 87(3), BA] cannot be proven. 


1.6 *Pari passu principle of distribution
29. The Rule in s 172: “Subject to the provisions of this Act as to preferential payments, the property of a company must, on its winding up, be applied pari passu in satisfaction of its liabilities and, subject to that application, must, unless the constitution of the company otherwise provides, be distributed among the members according to their rights and interests in the company.”
a) The pari passu rule is concerned with pro rata distribution amongst creditors – does not mean treating all creditors equally, but must treat LIKE CREDITORS ALIKE. So creditors will be entitled to a pari passu distribution of the assets in accordance with their rank in s 203 below

b) An agreement that allows priority grabbing by one creditor to the detriment of other creditors is invalid for contravening the pari passu rule, as the rules of general liquidation should prevail over contractual agreements due to public policy. This applies even if parties acted bona fide and lacked an intention to evade insolvency laws.

c) In other words, creditors are not allowed to contract out of the insolvency scheme for distribution. This (i) does not require a trigger event; (ii) does not depend on bona fides or intention; (iii) and commercial reasons are irrelevant.
i) Affirmed in Singapore by Joo Yee Construction Pte Ltd [1990].
ii) E.g. contracts where the company’s debtor is directed to pay the company’s unsecured creditors in the event of liquidation – this runs contrary to the pari passu principle, as some unsecured creditors will be benefited at the expense of others
 
30. Order of priority – s 203(1) IRDA, for unsecured debts (after the secured debts have been paid):
(a)first, the costs and expenses of the winding up incurred by the Official Receiver as the liquidator of the company, including the costs, expenses and remuneration of any licensed insolvency practitioner appointed by the Official Receiver under section 134(f) to act as liquidator in the place of the Official Receiver;(b)second, any other costs and expenses of the winding up, including the remuneration of the liquidator (apart from any remuneration mentioned in paragraph (a)) and the costs of any audit carried out under section 192;(c)third, the costs of the applicant for the winding up order payable under section 127;(d)fourth, subject to subsection (2), all wages or salary (whether or not earned wholly or in part by way of commission), including any amount payable by way of allowance or reimbursement under any contract of employment or any award or agreement regulating conditions of employment of any employee;(e)fifth, subject to subsection (2), the amount due to an employee as a retrenchment benefit or ex gratia payment under any contract of employment or any award or agreement that regulates conditions of employment, whether such amount becomes payable before, on or after the commencement of the winding up;(f)sixth, all amounts due in respect of work injury compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap. 354) accrued before, on or after the commencement of the winding up;(g)seventh, all amounts due in respect of contributions payable, during a period of 12 consecutive months commencing not earlier than 12 months before and ending not later than 12 months after the commencement of the winding up, by the company as the employer of any person, under any written law relating to employees’ superannuation or provident funds or under any scheme of superannuation which is an approved scheme under the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134);(h)eighth, subject to subsection (2), all remuneration payable to any employee in respect of vacation leave or, in the case of the employee’s death, to any other person in the employee’s right, accrued in respect of any period before, on or after the commencement of the winding up; and(i)ninth, the amount of all tax assessed, and all goods and services tax due, under any written law before the commencement of the winding up, and all tax assessed under any written law at any time before the time fixed for the proving of debts has expired.
31. Insolvency set-off – s 219, s 218. --> where the creditor is also a debtor of the company
a) Applicable in insolvent winding up and JM (s 219(1)).

b) s 219(2) IRDA: *Set off is mandatory if there were “any mutual credits, mutual debts or other mutual dealings between a company and any creditor”. 2 conditions:
i) Each claimant must be personally liable for the debt owed to each other, 
ii) each claimant must beneficially own the debt which is owed to him by the other and the ownership must be “clear and ascertainable” without inquiry

c) The effect of set-off is that claim, though provable, is paid to the extent of the set-off.

d) *Account is taken from the date of the commencement of the winding up, i.e. the date of the winding up ORDER 
i) (note that s 217 has different definitions of “commencement of the winding up” for different circumstances, but only applies from ss 224-229 (i.e. not to s 219))
ii) For the conversion date for foreign currency claims, the appropriate date in a compulsory liquidation is the date of the winding up ORDER, not the date of the winding up application (Re Lehman Brothers Finance Asia Private Limited)

e) In taking of an account, the *court may have regard to events which occurred since the commencement of winding up for the purpose of valuation.

f) What can be set-off? (s 219(4))
i) “A sum is to be regarded as being due to or from the company regardless of whether — (a) the sum is payable at present or in the future; (b) the obligation by virtue of which the sum is payable is certain or contingent; or (c) the sum is fixed or liquidated, or is capable of being ascertained by fixed rules or as a matter of opinion.”

g) What cannot be set-off? (s 219(3))
i) A debt or liability that is: “(a) is not a debt provable in judicial management or winding up; or (b) arises by reason of an obligation incurred at a time when the creditor had notice that an interim judicial manager had been appointed under section 94(3), or that the application for a judicial management order or the application for winding up (as the case may be) relating to the company was pending.”

h) SUMMARY of Conditions:
i) Mutual credits, mutual debits or mutual dealings (claim and cross-claim must be between same parties in the same right)  
ii) Mutual dealings must precede the liquidation 
iii) Claims must terminate in debt 
iv) Claim against company must be admissible to proof when account is actually taken. 
v) Claim of company must have matured as a debt when account is actually taken. 
vi) No notice of winding up application when obligation was incurred. 

32. Timing of Mutuality requirement – Panorama Development [2003] 1 SLR(R) 93
a) SGHC held that for the purposes of insolvency set-off, mutuality is determined at date of Commencement of Winding-up, though the actual account may take place later. 
b) Nonetheless agreed that it is strange that set-off occurs at the commencement of winding up whereas the provability of debt occurs later when the company goes into liquidation. Conceptually, since set-off is part of the law of proof, date for both must be the same, i.e. the date when the company goes into liquidation (at [56])

33. Estate Costs Rule – Liquidator may commence proceedings on behalf of the company, but any adverse costs orders made against the company will rank IN PRIORITY over the other general expenses of the liquidation and the claims of unsecured creditors. A liquidator who makes payments in breach of this rule will be held personally liable (Ho Wing On Christopher v ECRC Land Private Limited)


2 BANKRUPTCY
Insolvency for individuals.

2.1 Bankruptcy Proceedings
1. Jurisdiction
a) S 310(1) – domiciled in SG, OR has property in SG, OR resident/business in last 1 year.
310.—(1)  No bankruptcy application may be made to the Court under section 307(1)(a) or 308(1)(a) against an individual debtor unless the debtor —
(a)is domiciled in Singapore;(b)has property in Singapore; or(c)has, at any time within the period of one year immediately preceding the date of the making of the application —
(i)been ordinarily resident or has had a place of residence in Singapore; or(ii)carried on business in Singapore.
2. Who can make a bankruptcy application?
a) Creditor’s application – s 307: brought by a creditor or multiple creditors jointly, or also a nominee supervising the implementation of a voluntary arrangement

(i)	one of the individual’s creditors or jointly by more than one of them; or
(ii)	the nominee supervising the implementation of, or any person (other than the individual) who is for the time being bound by, a voluntary arrangement proposed by the individual and approved under Part 14; or

b) Debtor’s application – s 308: by the debtor themselves

c) See respective provisions for prescribed form and service requirements.

3. Grounds for bankruptcy application – s 311(1) – ALL of the following must be met for a bankruptcy application to be made – if one of these is not satisfied, then CANNOT make application:
a) 311(1)(a) Debt total more than SGD$15,000 AND
b) 311(1)(b) Each of the debts are for a liquidated sum payable to the creditor immediately AND
c) 311(1)(c) Debtor *unable to pay each of the debts AND
d) 311(1)(d) Where the debts are incurred outside of Singapore, they are payable due to a judgment or award enforceable by immediate execution in Singapore.
i) Ambank v Raymond Yong – Rationale is that the debt should have some connection to Singapore. Hence, if it was not incurred locally, the creditor must have in hand a “judgement [that] can be immediately executed by one of the specified modes of execution provided under the Rules of Court”. 
ii) Registering a foreign judgment may not be sufficient if it is not immediately enforceable.

4. Presumption of inability to pay debts – s 311(1)(c) and s 312. 
a) Helps show inability to pay debts. Satisfying any of these will lead to a rebuttable presumption of being unable to pay debts.

b) 4 alternative grounds (s 312):
i) *Non-compliance of a statutory demand served by an applicant creditor - failure to make payment OR failure to challenge the SD by applying to the Court to set it aside, within 21 days of receipt of SD [the main one]
ii) Execution issued against debtor in respect of a judgement debt owed to the applicant creditor has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part
iii) Debtor absconds from Singapore with the intention of defeating, delaying or obstructing a creditor in the recovery of the debt
iv) Official assignee denies or revokes certificates for debt repayment scheme (DRS).

c) NB expedited procedure where the creditor can file a bankruptcy application before the expiry of the 21-day statutory demand period if there is a serious possibility that the debtor’s property or value of all or any of his property will be significantly diminished during that period (s 314). 

d) A bankruptcy order will then be advertised and published in the Gazette, the commencement date of bankruptcy is the date of the bankruptcy order made against the debtor and continues until he is discharged (s 326).

5. Statutory Demand and Defects
a) Form of statutory demand in IRD(PI)R r 73, 64-65.
b) Required content under r 65:
i) The purpose of the demand, and the fact that if the debtor does not comply with the demand, bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced against the debtor. 
ii) The time within which the demand must be complied with if that consequence is to be avoided. 
iii) The methods of compliance available to the debtor. 
iv) The debtor’s right to apply to the Court to set aside the statutory demand. 
v) One or more named individuals with whom the debtor may, if the debtor wishes, enter into communication for purposes of securing or compounding for the debt to the satisfaction of the creditor. 
vi) The address and telephone number (if any) of any individual so named in the demand. 
c) Service – all reasonable steps to bring to debtor’s attention (r 66)
i) All reasonable steps and attempts to serve personally.
ii) The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp – parties can contract for a different mode of service, but Court may intervene if the agreed method is clearly unfair.
d) Setting aside statutory demand – r 67. Procedural defects or substantial debt disputes.
i) Procedure in r 67.
ii) Procedural defects
(1) R 68(2) – non-compliance with rules a ground for setting aside.
(2) Discretionary power of the Court generally only exercised if to avoid causing substantial injustice to the debtor.
iii) Debt substantially disputed
(1) Defendant only needs to show the presence of a substantial dispute, no need to disprove the presence of the debt. Same test as that of resisting summary judgment.
(2) I.e. that there is a ‘triable issue’.
(3) Wong Kwei Cheong – some evidence that a guarantee might be void for mistake was sufficient to raise a triable issue.
iv) Debt compounded or satisfied.
(1) Bombay Talkies – The debt is satisfied or compounded when the terms of the agreement result in an alternative obligation being accepted “in lieu or in satisfaction of the debt in question”, discharging the debt.

6. Bankruptcy application and hearing
a)  Key Provisions
i) S 315 – court can dismiss proceedings on bankruptcy application 
ii) S 318 – Court must be satisfied that debtor is unable to pay their debts.
iii) S 323 – withdrawal of bankruptcy applications
b) Chimbusco International – The test for a disputed debt is whether there are triable issues to be heard, such that the debtor is not required to prove that the debt was not owed. “the debtor need only raise triable issues in order to obtain a stay or a dismissal of bankruptcy proceedings.”

7. Bankruptcy Order
a) S 326 – bankruptcy commences on the day the order is made until person discharged.
b) Effect of order – see below.

2.2 *Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) (general understanding only)
8. Debt Repayment Scheme – involves the debtor paying off his creditors in accordance with a debt repayment plan (Part 15 IRDA, s 288 to s 306).
a) Debtor’s TOTAL liabilities cannot exceed S$150,000
b) Debtor must not be bankrupt or under any voluntary arrangement within 5 years immediately preceding the date of the bankruptcy application
c) Debtor must not be subject to any debt repayment scheme, or subject to one within 5 years immediately preceding the bankruptcy application
d) Debtor must not be a sole proprietor, partner of a firm or limited liability partnership

S 289(1) IRDA: Upon the Court adjourning a bankruptcy application made against a debtor and referring the matter to the Official Assignee under section 316(9) or 318(3), the Official Assignee must take such steps as are necessary to —
a) review the suitability of the debtor for a debt repayment scheme; and
b) where the debtor is suitable, implement the debt repayment scheme in accordance with this Part

S 291(1) IRDA: Subject to subsection (7), the Official Assignee must examine the statement of affairs and debt repayment plan submitted by a debtor under section 290(1) and the proofs of debts filed against the debtor and may make such modifications to the plan as the Official Assignee considers appropriate before convening a meeting of creditors under subsection (2).

S 291(7) IRDA: The repayment period under the debt repayment plan approved by the Official Assignee or modified by the Appeal Panel under this section *must not exceed 5 years.

If OA reports to the Court that the debtor is unsuitable for DRS, the Court will allow creditors to proceed with a bankruptcy application against the debtor.

However, a moratorium on bankruptcy applications will apply during the period of implementation of a DRS (s 293). But the right of any secured creditor to realise or deal with his security is NOT affected by the moratorium.

The debtor will be issued with a certificate of completion under s 301 if he repays his debts in accordance with the DRS.

2.3 *Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) (AN ALTERNATIVE TO BANKRUPTCY - general understanding only)

(6)  The Court may discharge the interim order if it is satisfied, on the application of the nominee —

2.4.2 Effect of Bankruptcy Order
7. S 327 – effect of order
Effect of bankruptcy order
327.—(1)  On the making of a bankruptcy order —
(a)the property of the bankrupt —
(i)vests in the Official Assignee without any further conveyance, assignment or transfer; and(ii)becomes divisible among the bankrupt’s creditors;(b)the Official Assignee is constituted the receiver of the bankrupt’s property; and(c)unless otherwise provided by Parts 3 and 13 to 22 —
(i)no creditor to whom the bankrupt is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy has any remedy against the person or property of the bankrupt in respect of that debt; and(ii)no action or proceedings may be proceeded with or commenced against the bankrupt in respect of that debt,
except by the leave of the Court and in accordance with such terms as the Court may impose.
(2)  Where a bankruptcy order is made against a firm, the order operates as if it were a bankruptcy order made against each of the persons who, at the time of the order, is a partner in the firm.
(3)  This section does not affect the right of any secured creditor to realise or otherwise deal with the secured creditor’s security in the same manner as the secured creditor would have been entitled to realise or deal with it if this section had not been enacted.
(4)  Despite subsection (3) and section 356, a secured creditor is not entitled to any interest in respect of the secured creditor’s debt after the making of a bankruptcy order unless the secured creditor —
(a)notifies the Official Assignee within 30 days after the date of the bankruptcy order of the secured creditor’s intention to claim such interest; and(b)realises the secured creditor’s security within —
(i)12 months after the date of the bankruptcy order (called in this section the realisation period); or(ii)such further period as the Official Assignee may determine on the application of the secured creditor made at least 30 days (or such shorter period as the Official Assignee may allow) before the expiry of the realisation period.
8. Dispositions of property will be void – s 328.
Restrictions on dispositions of property by bankrupt
328.—(1)  Where a person is adjudged bankrupt, any disposition of property made by the bankrupt during the period beginning on the day of the making of the bankruptcy application and ending on the day of the making of the bankruptcy order is void except to the extent that such disposition has been made with the consent of, or been subsequently ratified by, the Court.
(2)  For the purpose of this section, a disposition of property includes any payment (whether in cash or otherwise) made to any person by the bankrupt and accordingly, where any payment is void by virtue of this section, the person to whom the payment was made holds the sum paid for the bankrupt as part of the bankrupt’s estate.
(3)  [exceptions] Nothing in this section gives a remedy against any person in respect of —
(a)any property or payment which the person received from the bankrupt before the commencement of the bankruptcy in good faith, for value and without notice that the bankruptcy application had been made; or(b)any interest in property which derives from an interest in respect of which there is, by virtue of this subsection, no remedy.
(4)  Where, after the commencement of his or her bankruptcy, the bankrupt has incurred a debt to a banker or any other person by reason of the making of a payment which is void under this section, that debt is deemed for the purposes of Parts 3 and 13 to 22 to have been incurred before the commencement of the bankruptcy unless —
(a)that banker or person had notice of the bankruptcy before the debt was incurred; or(b)it is not reasonably practicable for the amount of the payment to be recovered from the person to whom it was made.
(5)  A disposition of property is void under this section even if the property is not or, as the case may be, would not be comprised in the bankrupt’s estate, but nothing in this section affects any disposition made by a person of property held by that person on trust for any other person.
a) Applies to dispositions in court orders – Cheo Sharon Andriesz [2013] 2 SLR 297 (CA) – This section applies to both personal dispositions and dispositions of property pursuant to court order, i.e. disposition of property made during this period, even if pursuant to court order, is void
b) Reasoning: Impossible to differentiate between settlement agreements and consent orders; thus they should be treated the same. (at [27])

3 JUDICIAL MANAGEMENT
3.1 Judicial Management Proceedings 
1. *Aims of Judicial Management – S 89.
Purpose of judicial management and judicial manager
89.—(1)  The judicial manager of a company must perform the judicial manager’s functions to achieve one or more of the following purposes of judicial management:
(a)the survival of the company, or the whole or part of its undertaking, as a going concern;(b)the approval under section 210 of the Companies Act 1967 or section 71 IRDA of a compromise or an arrangement between the company and any such persons as are mentioned in the applicable section;(c)a more advantageous realisation of the company’s assets or property than on a winding up.
(2)  A judicial manager or an interim judicial manager of a company must perform the functions of the judicial manager or interim judicial manager in the interests of the company’s creditors as a whole.
(3)  A judicial manager or an interim judicial manager of a company must perform the functions of the judicial manager or interim judicial manager as quickly and efficiently as is reasonably practicable.
(4)  A judicial manager or an interim judicial manager of a company is an officer of the Court (whether or not the judicial manager or interim judicial manager is appointed by the Court).
2. Court has jurisdiction to grant judicial management orders over any corporation (including foreign companies with a substantial nexus to SG) liable to be wound up under the IRDA.

3. JM allows companies in financial trouble an opportunity to rehabilitate and/or preserve the company’s business as a going concern. This is in contrast to winding up which is a measure of last resort.

4. In JM, there is a moratorium against proceedings and enforcement, which allows the company time and space to formulate a restructuring proposal and turnaround its business. Directors are replaced by independent professionals, and all directors’ powers vest in the judicial managers.

5. Application for JM is by way of an Originating Application (in open court), which is supported by affidavit setting out the grounds of the application.

6. Conditions to satisfy to apply for judicial management – S 90
Where a company, or any creditor of the company, considers —
(a) that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts; and
(b) that there is a: 
(i) reasonable probability of rehabilitating the company or 
(ii) of preserving all or part of its business as a going concern, or 
(iii) that the interests of creditors would be better served otherwise than by resorting to a winding up,

an application may be made to the Court under section 91 for an order that the company should be placed under the judicial management of a judicial manager.

7. Test of insolvency – s 125(2)
a) These are the “presumption of insolvency” provisions that will deem a company to be “unable to pay its debts”. Most common being a statutory demand.

3.1.1 *By Court Application (by company or creditor)
b) S 90: company itself (acting via a member’s resolution, or directors via director’s resolution) or any creditor can apply to Court if
i) Company unable to pay debts
ii) Reasonable probability of rehabilitating the company, OR of preserving all or part of its business as a going concern, OR interests of creditors better served this way.

c) S 91: 
i) S 91(1): 2 CONDITIONS – Court can grant JM via a judicial management order if
(1) Company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts, and
(2) the making of the order “would be likely” to achieve one or more of the purposes of JM in s 89(1).

ii) S 91(2): judicial management order made under subsection (1) must direct that during the period in which the company is in judicial management, the affairs, business and property of the company must be managed by a judicial manager appointed by the Court

iii) S 91(3): Judicial manager must be a licensed insolvency practitioner (but not the auditor of the company).

iv) Opposition to JM – S 91(6): Court MUST dismiss JM application if
(1) opposed by person entitled to appoint receiver & manager under a debenture secured by a floating charge, AND 
(2) if prejudice caused to the person opposing is “disproportionately greater” than prejudice caused to unsecured creditors. 

v) S 91(8): JM is not available for companies already in liquidation, and some prescribed companies.

vi) Public interest exception – s 91(10): Court can still appoint JM if public interest requires, **even if opposed by a floating charge holder or other creditors. 

--> Court has overriding power to make JM order based on public interest even if the court was not satisfied that one or more of the statutory purposes would be achieved. Applied in Re Cosmotron Electronics and Re Bintan Lagoon Resort.

d) S 92: Court can appoint interim judicial manager
i) Between making of application for JM, and making of JM order.

e) Court’s Discretion in Ordering JM – Deutsche Bank AG v Asia Pulp. 
i) Factor 1: Independent Report – The SG courts give weight to an independent report in assessing the viability of JM. 
(1) The court in Re Genesis Technologies International [1994] 2 SLR(R) 298 regarded the company’s failure to explain how it had got into its difficulties and how the situation was to be improved as crucial. 
(2) The court in Deutsche Bank AG v Asia Pulp & Paper Co Ltd took into account the opinions of experts in corporate restructuring (at [35])
ii) Factor 2: Interests of Creditors – In Re Genesis Technologies International [1994] 2 SLR(R) 298, it was held that “the court should be vigilant to ensure that [JM] is not directly or indirectly used by the directors and shareholders to the detriment of the creditors and unsecured creditors in particular.” (at [8])

NB: S 91(4)(a): When application for a JMO is made to court, a notice of the application must be published in the Gazette and in an English local daily newspaper, and a copy of the notice must be sent to the Registrar of Companies

S 91(4)(b): notice of the application must be also be given —
(i) to the company, in a case where a creditor is the applicant; and
(ii) to any person who has appointed, or is or may be entitled to appoint, a receiver and manager of the whole (or substantially the whole) of the company’s property under the terms of any debentures of the company secured by a floating charge, or by a floating charge and one or more fixed charges, that would be valid and enforceable in case of a liquidation of the company.

3.1.2 *By Resolution of Creditors (without an order of court)
a) S 94(1): same conditions as in s 91 – must be likely to achieve at least one of the purposes in s 89(1), in which case creditor’s resolution at a creditors’ meeting can be obtained to place company under JM without an order of court.

b) S 94(11)(d)-(e): Meeting must approve appointment of judicial manager by majority in number and value of creditors (50%) present and voting.
i) Company’s nominee may be opposed by creditors

3.2 Administration of Judicial Management
3.2.1 *Effect of applying for JM or making of JM order
1. Provisions
a) S 95 – automatic moratorium once JM application is made
i) No orders and resolutions shall be passed for the winding up of the company
ii) No steps shall be taken to enforce any charge or security over the company’s property
iii) No other proceedings and no execution or other legal process shall be commenced or continued except with leave of Court

NB: no specific automatic moratorium period of time– it just starts on the date the JM application is made and ends on the date the court decides on the JM application (s 95(4)(a) IRDA)

b) S 96 – expanded moratorium effects after JM order made, which applies until discharge (end) of JM Order.
i) Includes a prohibition against re-entry or forfeiture under a lease 
ii) Any receivers or managers appointed before the JM order must also step down from their appointments
iii) Any winding up applications will be dismissed
iv) Note s 95(3)(b) and s 95(5)(b) – Minister can prescribe by regulations certain carveouts to moratorium to allow certain proceedings to be commenced or continued despite the JM moratorium. E.g. filing of writs for an admiralty action will not be affected
v) *Contractual right of set-off of the creditors against the company are NOT affected by moratorium – s 96(5). This is because contractual set-off rights are seen as self-help remedies rather than a proceeding or enforcement action

Electro Magnetic (S) Ltd v DBS: 
Definition of “security” (s 95(1)(b), s 96(4)(e), IRDA)
? “The term “security” has not been defined in the Act; it should therefore bear the natural and ordinary meaning. A security over a property consists of some real or proprietary interest, legal or equitable, in the property as distinguished from a personal right or claim thereon.” (at [11])
? Right to set-off?
o A right of set-off does not fall within the definition of “security”. “A right of set-off is a personal right; it is a right given by contract or by law to set one claim against the other and arrive at a balance.” (at [11])
o Goode (affirmed by SGCA): “A security interest is a real thing in the asset given in security. A right of set-off, even if given by contract, is a purely personal right to set one claim against another. The party asserting it never acquires rights in the other’s monetary claim at all; he merely asserts a countervailing claim which operates in pro tanto extinction of his monetary liability. It follows that a contractual set-off does not create a security interest.” (at [11])

Definition of “step taken” (s 95(1)(b), s 96(4)(e), IRDA)
? Bristol Airport plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 (CA) per Woolf LJ: A person does not take steps to enforce a security “unless, by relying on the security, [the person is] preventing the administrator [from] doing something to [the chattel] in which he has an interest which he would otherwise be entitled to do.” (cited with approval at at [30])
o Application of this rule means that serving a demand or notice is not a step taken to enforce the security because it does not prevent the administrator from doing something he is otherwise entitled to do. 

Definition of “proceedings” (s 95(1)(c), s 96(4)(c), IRDA)
? “the word “proceedings” connotes a process initiated whether in court or by way of arbitration or a step in such process.” (at [18])
? “An exercise of a right of set-off is an extra-legal step and is not such a process or a step in such process. Exercising the right of set-off is a self-help remedy.” (at [18])

Enforcement on possession-based securities (s 95(1)(b), s 96(4)(e), IRDA)
? In Bristol Airport plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 (CA), it was held that unqualified refusal to hand over is taking a step to enforce the security (the lien holder asserting his lien) (cited at [30]). The EWCA thought that this interpretation accorded with the statutory purpose of administration. If retention does not require leave of court, the administrator will be forced to pay the lien holder, contrary to the rationale of the moratorium. 
? The Court in this case held that that “A lien is essentially a passive right of retention” (at [30]). On the facts, DBS had a lien on the bills, and its refusal to hand over the bills as demanded by the owners of the bills was an act enforcing the lien. 

2. Period of JM
a) JM order, unless discharged, remains in force for 180 days from making of order.
b) May be extended by an order of the court.
c) Note: s 111(3) allows extension of JM order by approval of creditors by majority in number and value, in writing or at a creditor’s meeting, without court order.

(3)  A receiver, or receiver and manager, of a company who vacates office under subsection (1)(a) is not required, on or after so vacating office, to take steps to comply with any duty imposed on the receiver, or receiver and manager, by section 86.

4. Legislation – s 225-226 IRDA (for companies); s 362-363 IRDA (for bankrupt individuals).

Unfair preferences
225.—(1)  Subject to this section and sections 226 and 227, where a company is in judicial management or is being wound up, and the company has at the relevant time (as defined in section 226), given an unfair preference to any person, the judicial manager or liquidator (as the case may be) may apply to the Court for an order under this section.
(2)  The Court may, on such an application, make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given that unfair preference.
(3)  For the purposes of this section and sections 226 and 227, a company gives an unfair preference to a person if —
(a)that person is one of the company’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; and(b)the company does anything or suffers anything to be done which (in either case) has the effect of **putting that person into a position which, in the event of the company’s winding up, will be better than the position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done.
(4)  The Court must not make an order under this section in respect of an unfair preference given to any person unless the company which gave the preference was influenced in deciding to give the unfair preference by a desire to produce in relation to that person the effect mentioned in subsection (3)(b).
(5)  A company which has given an unfair preference to a person who, at the time the unfair preference was given, was connected with the company (otherwise than by reason only of being the company’s employee) is presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to have been influenced in deciding to give the unfair preference by such a desire as is mentioned in subsection (4).
(6)  The fact that something has been done pursuant to an order of a court does not, without more, prevent the doing or suffering of that thing from constituting the giving of an unfair preference.
a) S 226 – relevant time under s 224 and 225. 
i) Unfair preference + connected person (with the company, but not as an employee) = 2 years before commencement of JM/winding up

ii) Unfair preference + unconnected person = 1 year before commencement of JM/winding up

iii) And any time after commencement of JM/winding up.

b) BUT ALSO the requirement that company is insolvent OR transaction caused insolvency – s 226(2)

Relevant time under sections 224 and 225
226.—(1)  Subject to this section, the time at which a company enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives an unfair preference is a relevant time if the transaction is entered into or the preference given —
(a)in the case of a transaction at an undervalue — within the period starting 3 years before the commencement of the judicial management or winding up (as the case may be) and ending on the date of the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be;(b)in the case of an unfair preference which is not a transaction at an undervalue and which is given to a person who is connected with the company (otherwise than by reason only of being the company’s employee) — within the period starting 2 years before the commencement of the judicial management or winding up (as the case may be) and ending on the date of the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be; and(c)in any other case of an unfair preference — within the period starting one year before the commencement of the judicial management or winding up (as the case may be) and ending on the date of the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be.
(2)  Where a company enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives an unfair preference at a time mentioned in subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c), that time is not a relevant time for the purposes of sections 224 and 225 unless the company —
(a)is unable to pay its debts at that time within the meaning of section 125(2); or(b)becomes unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 125(2) in consequence of the transaction or preference.
(3)  Where a transaction is entered into at an undervalue by a company with a person who is connected with the company (otherwise than by reason only of being the company’s employee), the requirements under subsection (2) are presumed to be satisfied unless the contrary is shown.
(4)  Despite subsection (1), the time at which a company enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives an unfair preference is a relevant time if the transaction is entered into or the preference given during the period starting on the date of the commencement of the judicial management in respect of the company and ending on the date the company entered judicial management.
(5)  Where any period mentioned in subsection (6) in respect of a company coincides with any period mentioned in subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) in respect of that company, the time at which a transaction at an undervalue is entered into or an unfair preference is given by that company is a relevant time if that transaction is entered into or that preference is given during the period immediately before that period mentioned in subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) (as the case may be) that is equal to the sum of all such periods mentioned in subsection (6) coinciding with the period mentioned in subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c), as the case may be.
(6)  The periods mentioned in subsection (5) are any of the following: [related to schemes of arrangement]
(a)the automatic moratorium period mentioned in section 64(8);(b)the period during which an order under section 64(1)(a) is in force in relation to the company, including any extension of that period under section 64(7);(c)the period during which an order under section 65(1)(a) is in force in relation to the company, including any extension of that period under section 65(5);(d)the period during which an order under section 210(10) of the Companies Act 1967 is in force in relation to the company.
c) S 227 – Orders under s 224 and 225.

5.  Comparison between Preference and Undervalue
a) Key difference between preference and undervalue transactions: The same transaction may be in part a preference and in part an undervalue. However, the same part cannot be BOTH an undervalue and a preference at the same time
i) E.g.: X transferred an asset worth $3m to Y to pay a debt of $1m. 
ii) If the payment satisfies the conditions in s 225, it is a preference to the extent of $1m worth of the asset. Next, if the transfer satisfies the conditions in s 224, it is an undervalue transaction to the extent of the remaining $2m worth of the asset.

b) It is possible that the transfer is not a preference (for e.g., X was not influenced by a desire to prefer Y) but is an undervalue transaction. If so, any court order is restricted to the latter (undervalue). For e.g., court may order Y to pay $2m to X, or Y to retransfer the asset back to X on X paying $1m to Y.

c) Undervalue transaction: Withdrawing assets from the pool to the detriment of ALL OTHER creditors

d) Unfair preference: Preferring one creditor over other creditors

e) If you do something to an existing debt (yourself being the debtor), likely a preference

6. *Elements of Unfair Preference (summary)
a) Standing: 
i) Preferred party is a creditor OR a surety OR guarantor of the insolvent party

b) Insolvency: 
i) Company was insolvent OR became insolvent at the time of giving the preference
ii) Test for insolvency – refer to s 125(2).

c) Factual preference: 
i) Insolvent party does anything or suffers anything to be done which has the effect of putting the creditor into a position which, in the event of the insolvent party’s bankruptcy or liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done.

d) Mental element (of insolvent party): 
i) Insolvent party was influenced in deciding to enter transaction by a desire to prefer the creditor.
ii) Rebuttable presumption for transactions with connected persons.

e) Relevant time of unfair preference:
i) Unfair preference + connected or associated person = within 2 years before commencement of winding up or JM (for insolvent company) / making of the bankruptcy application (for bankrupt individuals)
ii) Unfair preference + unconnected person = within 1 year before commencement of winding up or JM (for insolvent company) / making of the bankruptcy application (for bankrupt individuals)

8. Cases
a) *Rebuttable presumption of “influenced by desire to prefer” for connected persons – Progen Engineering [2010] 4 SLR 1089
i) s 225(5) IRDA; s 362(5) IRDA presumption of influence by desire to prefer for connected persons.
ii) Payment to party within 2 years prior to liquidation.
iii) Burden is on payee (i.e. recipient of unfair preference) to rebut presumption that payment was not influenced by company’s desire to prefer payee.

b) Desire to prefer – DBS Bank Ltd v Tam Chee Chong [2011] 4 SLR 948 (CA): 
i) The test is not whether there is a dominant intention to prefer, but whether the debtor’s decision was influenced by a desire to prefer the creditor.
(1) The court will look at the desire (a subjective state of mind) of the debtor to determine whether it had positively wished to improve the creditor’s position in the event of its own liquidation.
(2) The requisite desire may be proved by direct evidence, or its existence may be inferred from the existing circumstances of the case.
(3) *It is SUFFICIENT that the desire to prefer is one of the factors which influenced the decision to enter into the transactions; it need not be the sole or decisive factor.
(4) A transaction which is actuated by proper commercial consideration will not constitute a voidable preference. 
(5) A genuine belief in the existence of a proper commercial consideration may be sufficient (as a defence) even if, objectively, such a belief might not be sustainable.

ii) Desire to prefer was found – Rabobank v Jurong Technologies Industrial Corp Ltd [2011] 4 SLR 977
(1) Commercial pressure by party receiving the preference may sometimes negate the debtor’s desire to prefer, but it ultimately depends on the evidence
(2) CA in Rabobank upheld the High Court’s findings that notwithstanding the pressure exerted by Rabobank (party who received preference), who had received payment prior to the debtors’ appointment of JM, the debtors had desired to prefer Rabobank
(3) Similar to Rabobank, but DBS applied even less pressure on the debtor-company in comparison. It did not serve a letter of demand until very late – after the company had given it a charge as security. 
(4) As in Rabobank case, Lin gave evidence that the company executed the charge because DBS had been very supportive of the group. The trial judge preferred evidence of Lin to that of the DBS officer who made up answers to support her case that the company gave the charge because it had no choice in the matter. 
(5) Although the company was in default, DBS did not threaten to declare a default or recall its banking facilities. The reason was because that was not in its interest. 

9. *Remedies or Effect of finding unfair preference – 
a) Does not render transaction void or voidable, but Court has power to reverse it.
b) Orders can be made under s 227 IRDA
c) NB: remedies can also be ordered against non-parties to the transaction who ultimately received any money, interest in property, etc. (s 227(2) and 227(4) IRDA)

(2)  An order under section 224 or 225 may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not that person is the person with whom the company in question entered into the transaction or the person to whom the unfair preference was given, as the case may be.
(3)  An order under section 224 or 225 does not —
(a)prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in question and was acquired in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest; or(b)require a person who received a benefit from the transaction or unfair preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the company, the judicial manager or the liquidator, except where that person was a party to the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of an unfair preference given to that person at a time when that person was a creditor of the company in question 
--> i.e. the court can require that person to pay the company, JM or liquidator if he was party to the undervalued transaction or received unfair preference as a creditor of the company at that time.
(4)  For the purposes of subsection (3)(a) and (b), a person (called in this section the relevant person) who has acquired an interest in property from a person other than the company in question [i.e. the interest is traceable – does not matter if the person got it from someone else other than the insolvent company directly], or who has received a benefit from the transaction or unfair preference, is presumed (unless the contrary is shown) to have acquired the interest or received the benefit (as the case may be) otherwise than in good faith if, at the time of that acquisition or receipt — --> rebuttable presumption arises as long as one of the 2 requirements are satisfied
(a)the relevant person had notice of the relevant surrounding circumstances and of the relevant proceedings; OR(b)the relevant person was connected with —
(i)the company in question; or(ii)the person with whom the company in question entered into the transaction, or to whom the company gave the unfair preference, as the case may be. --> i.e. if the relevant person is CONNECTED with the person who first received the property / benefit from the company
(5)  For the purposes of subsection (4)(a), the relevant surrounding circumstances are —
(a)the fact that the company in question entered into the transaction at an undervalue; or(b)the circumstances which amounted to the giving of the unfair preference by the company in question.
(6)  For the purposes of subsection (4)(a), the relevant person has notice of the relevant proceedings if the relevant person has notice of —
(a)the appointment of an interim judicial manager under section 94(3), the making of an application for a judicial management order, the making of an application for winding up in respect of the company, or the appointment of or the obligation to appoint a provisional liquidator under section 161; or(b)the fact that the company has entered judicial management or is being wound up.

(a)the company makes a gift to that person or otherwise enters into a transaction with that person on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration; or(b)the company enters into a transaction with that person for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by the company.
(4)  The Court must not make an order under this section in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if —
(a)the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business; and(b)at the time the company entered into the transaction, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.
11. Relevant time under s 224 and 225 – S 226 (see above for full provisions)

iii) Enters into a transaction for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of consideration provided (s224(3)(b) IRDA).

b) Insolvency: s 226(2)
i) The individual was insolvent or became insolvent as a consequence of that transaction.
ii) S 226(3) IRDA; S 363(3) IRDA: for transaction at an undervalue with connected persons or associates rebuttable presumption that this is satisfied 
--> i.e. when transaction at undervalue entered into with a connected person or associate, the company or individual is PRESUMED to be insolvent at time of transaction or became insolvent due to the transaction.
--> person resisting need to rebut that the company or individual did not become insolvent because of the transaction

c) Relevant time: S 226 (see above for full provisions)
i) For companies: within 3 years before commencement of winding up or JM (s226(1)(a) IRDA).
ii) Any time during judicial management is a relevant time – s 226(4).
iii) For individuals: within the period of 3 years ending on the day of the making of the bankruptcy application on which the individual is adjudged bankrupt (s363(1)(a)(ii) IRDA)

d) NOTE *statutory defence for the insolvent party in s 224(4) IRDA
i) Transaction in good faith for purpose of carrying on its business; AND
ii) At the time, reasonable grounds to believe it would benefit company.
 
13. Cases (mostly from slides)
a) Meaning of “transaction” – Mercator & Noordstar NV v Velstra Pte Ltd [2003] 4 SLR(R) 667 
i) A “transaction” includes a unilateral act of payment and includes a gift.
ii) No further requirement of mutuality.

b) Insolvent party needs to intend to enter transaction – Velstra Pte Ltd v Dexia Bank NV [2005] 1 SLR(R) 154
i) It is necessary for the insolvent party to have intended to “enter into a transaction” with the counterparty.
ii) Mistaken payment to an unintended recipient would NOT be regarded as an undervalue transaction.

c) Valuation – Buildspeed Construction v Theme Corp Pte Ltd [2000] 1 SLR(R) 287
i) The value provided by each party must be assessed in light of the circumstances prevailing at the time of the transaction.

d) Grant of security may be included as part of undervalued transaction – Encus International v Tenacious Investment [2016] HC
i) Basically – grant of security can be the subject of an undervalue transaction.
ii) An older UK case, Bacon, had held that a grant of security cannot be valued, thus ex hypothesi it cannot come under the undervalue transaction.
iii) SGHC in dicta preferred another case, Hill, where the EWCA rejected the argument that a grant of security did not involve the disposition of any property right in favour of the grantee. Whilst there is no change in the physical assets of the debtor when the security is given, there seems no reason why the value of the right to have recourse to the security and to take priority over other creditors should be left out of account.

e) **Grant of security not included as undervalued transaction, unless it’s for a 3P’s debt – Rothstar Group v Leow Quek Shiong [2022] SGCA 25
i) TLDR: clarification and part-reversal; 
(1) Generally, analyse grant of security using preference.
(2) Q is whether it depletes net assets. Insolvent party cannot grant security for a 3P’s debt, which would be considered undervalued transaction as it reduces the net assets of the insolvent party.
ii) *CA preferred Bacon over Hill: “the grant of security for the grantor’s (insolvent party’s own) existing debt will not, in principle, constitute a transaction at an undervalue” (at [39])
(1) The principle is that where an insolvent party grants security for its indebtedness, the grant of security will not amount to an undervalued transaction. This is because the grant of security for the insolvent party's own indebtedness does not deplete the insolvent party’s assets or diminish their value (at [36])
(2) “Instead, because its effect is “simply to allocate the asset given in security to a particular creditor instead of leaving it available for creditors generally”, it will be more appropriate to examine the impugned transaction in the context of the principles governing unfair preferences” (at [40])

iii) *Limited exception: Grant of fresh security by an insolvent party for the existing indebtedness of a third party may be an undervalue transaction (at [44], [45])
(1) In such a situation, “the grant of security would reduce the net assets of the [insolvent party] as it would impose a new liability which the [insolvent party] did not previously have.” (at [43])
(2) Outgoing consideration: Value of the security 
(3) Incoming consideration: Benefit to the insolvent party in granting the security for a 3P, in money’s worth
  
14. Valuation of assets (not asterisked)
a) Issue: Should the value of a company’s assets be adjusted downwards when it is in financial difficulty? This arises because if a company is in financial distress, a sale of its assets usually involves a discount to market value.
b) Rule: A company undergoing financial difficulties does not make an undervalue transaction if it pays a debt owed to a creditor at face value. This is despite the debt arguably not being worth their face value as the creditors are unlikely to regain the full sum during the liquidation (Leun Wah Electric). This must be right in principle as a contrary position would force every repayment of a debt to be discounted – that is not the proper province of undervalue transaction law. 
 
15. Defences
a) For counterparties
i) s 224(4): if company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business; if at the time transaction was entered into, there were reasonable grounds to believe that it would benefit the company
b) For third parties
i) A third party who acquires any interest in property from the counterparty (which is not the company) is protected if he acquires it in good faith and for value. Any interest deriving from such an interest is also protected: s 227(3)(a).
ii) A third party who received a benefit from the transaction is protected if he receives it in good faith and for value: s 227(3)(b). 
 
16. Remedies
a) s 224(2): Broad remedial scope, but the overriding principle is that the court is to make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into the transaction. 
b) Not limited to counterparty in transaction – s 227(1)(d) & (2): The court orders listed are not restricted to being directed against the counterparty to the undervalue transaction. 
c) Types of property affected – s 227(2): An order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not that person is the person with whom the company entered into the transaction. 
d) This broad remedial scope requires a defence, especially for third parties – s 227(3). 

4.3 Transactions and dispositions after commencement of winding up (s130 IRDA – for companies; s328 IRDA – for bankrupt individuals)
17. NOTE: probably typo in the syllabus doc, should be s 328 instead of 238.

18. Void Disposition (s 130 IRDA)
a) Note – these are for post-application dispositions, before the order is made. This action can only be brought for transactions/dispositions taking place after the winding up application has been filed

b) In contrast, unfair preference and undervalue transactions are for pre-application deals.

c) If winding up order is ultimately made, any disposition of the property of the company post-application is void retrospectively, unless court validates it. 
i) RECALL: This is because per s 126 (see “Timing”), when winding up is ordered, “commencement of winding up” is essentially backdated to application date.

Avoidance of dispositions of property and certain attachments, etc.
130.—(1)  Any disposition of the property of the company, including things in action, and any transfer of shares or alteration in the status of the members of the company, made after the commencement of the winding up by the Court is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void.
(2)  Any attachment, sequestration, distress or enforcement order put in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up by the Court is, unless the Court otherwise orders, void. 
d) Also, s 328 IRDA – restriction on disposition by bankrupt.
 
19. Dispositions pursuant to court order are also void – Cheo Sharon Andriesz v Official Assignee of the estate of Andriesz Paul Matthew [2013] 2 SLR 297 
a) Disposition by bankrupt of properties to former wife pursuant to consent judgment in divorce suit. Here, the disposition took place after filing of bankruptcy application.
b) Held: Section 77 Bankruptcy Act (s 328 IRDA) applied to a disposition of property pursuant to a court order
c) Reasoning: Impossible to differentiate between settlement agreements and consent orders; thus they should be treated the same. (at [27])
d) Important for parties to litigation to conduct bankruptcy searches before commencing litigation.
 
20. Cases (from slides, not asterisked)
a) Does not include recipient who already held beneficial interest – QCD Sdn Bhd v Wah nam Plastic Industry Pte Ltd [1997] 1 SLR(R) 270 
i) The word “disposition” does not include the process by which a person with a beneficial interest in the property obtains that property, or the proceeds of realization from the company at a time when he is entitled to have it. 
ii) Realisation and enforcement of security interests of secured creditors will not be regarded as void dispositions (because they had already been entitled to it)

4.4 Floating Charges granted prior to winding up (s229 IRDA)
21. Note: There is no subheading for this in the syllabus guide, but this provision is asterisked at the start of Section 4, and there are slides for it.

22. Provisions

Avoidance of certain floating charges
229.—(1)  A floating charge on the company’s property created at a relevant time is invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of —
(a)the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge as consists of money paid, or goods or services supplied, to the company at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge;(b)the value of so much of that consideration as consists of the discharge or reduction, at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, of any debt of the company; and(c)the amount of such interest (if any) as is payable on the amount falling within paragraph (a) or (b) pursuant to any agreement under which the money was so paid, the goods or services were so supplied or the debt was so discharged or reduced.
(2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (5), the time at which a floating charge is created by a company is a relevant time for the purposes of this section if the charge is created —
(a)in the case of a charge which is created in favour of a person who is connected with the company, at a time within the period of 2 years ending on the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be;(b)in the case of a charge which is created in favour of any other person, at a time within the period of one year ending on the commencement of the judicial management or winding up, as the case may be; or(c)at a time within the period starting on the commencement of the judicial management of the company and ending on the date the company enters judicial management.
(3)  Where a company creates a floating charge at a time mentioned in subsection (2)(b) and the person in whose favour the charge is created is not connected with the company, that time is not a relevant time for the purposes of this section unless the company —
(a)is at that time unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 125(2); or(b)becomes unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 125(2) in consequence of the transaction under which the charge is created.
(4)  For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the value of any goods or services supplied by way of consideration for a floating charge is the amount in money which at the time they were supplied could reasonably have been expected to be obtained for supplying the goods or services in the ordinary course of business and on the same terms (apart from the consideration) as those on which they were supplied to the company.
(5)  Where any period mentioned in subsection (6) in respect of a company coincides with any period mentioned in subsection (2)(a), (b) or (c) in respect of that company, the time at which a floating charge is created by that company is a relevant time if the floating charge is created during the period immediately before that period mentioned in subsection (2)(a), (b) or (c) (as the case may be) that is equal to the sum of all such periods mentioned in subsection (6) coinciding with the period mentioned in subsection (2)(a), (b) or (c), as the case may be.
(6)  The periods mentioned in subsection (5) are any of the following: [related to schemes of arrangement]
(a)the automatic moratorium period mentioned in section 64(8);(b)the period during which an order under section 64(1)(a) is in force in relation to the company, including any extension of that period under section 64(7);(c)the period during which an order under section 65(1)(a) is in force in relation to the company, including any extension of that period under section 65(5);(d)the period during which an order under section 210(10) of the Companies Act 1967 is in force in relation to the company. 
23. Elements
a) Floating charges granted prior to commencement of winding up or JM may be invalid, except to the extent of – 
i) Fresh consideration provided to the company which granted the floating charge
ii) Interest on fresh consideration provided to the company which granted the floating charge

I.e. if there is fresh consideration or interest provided, then the floating charges granted by the insolvent company remain valid

b) Must be in the relevant time for a challenge – s 229(2)
i) 2 years before commencement for connected persons 
ii) 1 year before commencement for unconnected persons

c) Insolvency – company must be insolvent or became insolvent as a result.
i) This insolvency requirement is only required for floating charges in favour of unconnected persons (s 229(3) IRDA)
ii) Thus, if floating charges are granted to connected persons, there is NO INSOLVENCY REQUIREMENT for the company – i.e. easier to void the floating charge since this requirement does not need to be fulfilled

4.5 *Fraudulent Trading (s238 IRDA)
24. Legislation – s 238.

Responsibility for fraudulent trading
238.—(1)  If, in the course of the judicial management or winding up of a company or in any proceedings against a company, it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the application of the judicial manager, liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper to do so, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner is personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the Court directs.
(2)  Where the Court makes any declaration under subsection (1), it may give such further directions as it thinks proper for the purpose of giving effect to that declaration and in particular —
(a)may make provision for making the liability of any person under the declaration a charge —
(i)on any debt or obligation due from the company to the person liable; or(ii)on any charge or any interest in any charge on any assets of the company held by or vested in —
(A)the person liable;(B)any corporation or other person on behalf of the person liable; or(C)any person claiming as assignee from or through the person liable or any corporation or person acting on behalf of the person liable; and(b)may from time to time make such further order as is necessary for the purpose of enforcing any charge imposed under this subsection.

(5)  Subsection (4) applies to a company whether or not it has been, or is in the course of being, wound up, and whether or not it has been, or is, in judicial management.
(6)  This section has effect even if the person concerned is criminally liable apart from this section in respect of the matters on the ground of which the declaration is made.

a) Personal liability of directors or others dealing with company
b) A party to the carrying on of business in such manner may be personally liable  
c) Applicable to both winding up and JM, whether or not it is ongoing.

25. Fraudulent Trading – Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict [2004] and [2005]
a) Business of the company had been carried on with the intent to defraud the creditors of the company or of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, then this amounts to fraudulent trading
b) Meaning of fraud
i) Defendants must be knowing parties to the carrying on of the business in that manner
ii) “Defraud” and “fraudulent purpose” connote “actual dishonesty involving, according to current notions of fair trading among commercial men, real moral blame”.
iii) To defraud was to cheat, and cheating was an act or omission in which the fraudster deceived the innocent party so as to enrich the fraudster or cause the innocent party to suffer loss or detriment
c) Subjective/objective test: The test looks at the subjective intention of the defendant and whether had acted in good faith, but tested against the objective standard of an honest and reasonable man as well as against the weight of other objective facts. 


4.6 *Wrongful Trading (s239 IRDA)

5 SCHEMES OF ARRANGEMENT
5.1 Preliminary matters 
1. Objective and purpose of SOA
a) SOA is a versatile statutory procedure (can be used by solvent and insolvent companies, members, creditors, etc.). It enables a company to enter into a scheme of arrangement (SOA) with its creditors and/or members. It is not an insolvency proceeding, unlike JM or receivership. 
b) In essence, it is a procedure to enable a majority to bind a minority to achieve a broad range of objectives, for e.g. take-overs, reorganisation of share capital, corporate rescue (mainly through restructuring the company’s balance sheet by reducing the company’s debt burden), etc. 
i) Thus, a SOA allows the company to compromise with all creditors with the agreement of a majority of creditors. 
ii) Given that dissenting creditors are also bound to the scheme, their interests are protected by requiring the court to ensure the scheme is fair before it grants approval. 
c) Cf. JM or winding up
i) Management remains in control of the company 
d) Focus is on SOA as a debt restructuring tool for creditors of insolvent companies.
e) Note: Similar to Individual Voluntary Arrangement in bankruptcy for individuals?

2.  Provisions
a) S 66 – s 72 IRDA; s 210-211 CA

3. Overall idea – 3 stages of SOA (from Royal Bank of Scotland v TT International)
a) Threshold: formulate a proposal. 
i) Apply for stay under s210(10), CA or moratorium under s 64, IRDA. --> where an automatic interim moratorium will arise

b) Stage 1: First Hearing. 
i) ss 210(1) & (2), CA – The company applies to the court for the court to order that meetings be convened to vote on the scheme proposal. Also known as the “leave for hearing”.

c) Stage 2: Creditor’s Meeting
i) s 210(3) – voting by creditors on proposed scheme of arrangement.

d) Stage 3: Court Sanction.
i) If sanctioned by court, scheme proposal becomes binding on all creditors and the company.

5.2 Application for leave to convene meeting
5.2.1 *Who can apply? 
4. Which companies eligible for SOA?
a) Meaning of “company” – s 63(3) IRDA; s 210(11) CA.
i) Any corporation liable to be wound up under the IRDA.
(1) Corporation is defined in s 4, CA to include a foreign company. Foreign company is defined in s 4 CA to include a company incorporated outside Singapore.
ii) “Substantial connection” with Singapore. 
iii) Under the Companies (Prescribed Companies and Entities) Order 2017, banks, public utilities, finance companies, etc, are excluded.
 
5. *Who can apply for SOA?
a) S 210(2) CA – the persons who can apply are
i) For a company being wound up, the liquidator
ii) Otherwise, the company itself OR any creditor or member.

b) For a company under JM, the judicial manager (s 117)
i) Creditor’s scheme: If the company is in judicial management and the creditors voted for the company to pass a scheme, the judicial manager will be the person responsible for proposing it and s 117 applies. 
ii) The purpose of s 117 is to bring in the relevant provisions on scheme of arrangement to a scheme within the context of JM and modify them where necessary. The scheme provisions brought in are s 210, CA, and ss 68, 69, 70, 71 – “At any time when a company is in judicial management, section 210, CA applies if...; s 68 applies if...”. 
iii) Note especially s 117(a) – brings in application of s 210, CA. 
 
5.2.2 *Application process to court for leave to convene meeting
a) Application is to be made under s 210 CA
i) Made via ex parte originating summons – O 38 r 2(1): Unless otherwise provided in the Act or this Order, every application under the Act must be made by originating application and these Rules apply subject to this Order.
ii) Must be supported by affidavit of a duly authorised person in the company

b) Starting Point: The Court may order a meeting of the creditors, members, shareholders and any other class of persons where a compromise or an arrangement has been proposed between the company and any of them (s 210(1) CA). 

c) The Royal Bank of Scotland NV v TT International Ltd [2012] 2 SLR 213: An application for leave to convene a meeting is “*NOT a hearing to consider the merits and fairness of the schemes. […] The matters for consideration at this stage concern the jurisdiction of the court to sanction the scheme if it proceeds.” (at [63])
o The role of the court is primarily to decide **whether a meeting should be called and the manner in which it should be conducted

d) Scheme must have realistic prospect of success – TT International.
i) If there is no realistic prospect of a scheme receiving the requisite approval, the court should NOT act in vain in granting the application for the meeting to be convened.

e) Minimal level of disclosure required at application stage (cf voting stage): 
i) The company’s solicitors are required to unreservedly disclose all material information to the court to assist it in arriving at an informed decision on how the scheme creditors’ meeting is to be conducted, hence, any issues in relation to a possible need for separate meetings for different classes of creditors should be brought home to the attention of the court. (Royal Bank of Scotland NV v TT International Ltd at [57] – [64]). 

ii) While this is a lower standard of disclosure as compared to that at the voting stage, the applicant-company must still satisfy the baseline standard, and therefore bears a duty of unreserved disclosure to assist the court in determining whether and how the creditors’ meeting is to be conducted. This must be taken to require at least such disclosure as would enable the court to determine the issues that it must properly consider at this stage, such as the classification of creditors, the proposal’s realistic prospects of success, and any allegation of abuse of process. (Pathfinder Strategic Credit LP v Empire Credit Resources [2019] 2 SLR 77). 
(1) If the disclosure made is so lacking at the leave stage and it appears that nothing further will be forthcoming, there would be no reason for the court to grant leave under s 210(1). This is quite aside from whether the scheme is doomed to fail or whether there is an inference of abuse of process. Rather, the overarching focus in this context is on the question of fairness in the conduct of the creditors’ meeting, and the sufficiency of the financial disclosure is pivotal to that end because it underpins the integrity of the scheme regime and provides a real safeguard to this exercise in creditor democracy.

5.2.3 *Effect of Application – Interim Moratorium 
6. Stay order under s 210(10) CA
a) Power of court to restrain proceedings against the company –  Where 
i) no order has been made or resolution passed for the winding up of a company; 
ii) any such compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors or any class of such creditors [i.e. compromise already proposed]
iii) on the application in a summary way of the company or of any member or creditor of the company 
--> these parties can apply for stay order under s 210(10) CA
iv) restrain further proceedings in any action or proceeding against the company except by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes

7. Must be bona fide application with sufficient particulars: there must be a proposed scheme, while not necessarily ready for presenting to the creditors to be voted upon, with sufficient particulars to enable the court to assess that it is feasible, that it merits due consideration by the creditors when it is eventually placed before them in detailed form, and the intention to enter a scheme was bona fide (Re Conchubar Aromatics Ltd [2015] SGHC 322 at [5], [12])
a) Here, parties were committed to a 10-week timeline and to provide regular updates. The application also had sufficient particulars to show that it was bona fide. 
b) Further, an application for a stay order may be made before the making of the CA s 210(1) application, provided that there were sufficient details in the proposed scheme for the court to consider its feasibility, and that the intention to invoke s 210 to enter into a scheme with the creditors was bona fide.
5.2.4 *Automatic Interim Moratorium (s 64 IRDA)
8. Pointers
a) S 64 IRDA and S 210 CA seem to overlap. 
i) But see s 64(2)(c) – can only pick one to get protection.
ii) And there is only immediate automatic protection under s 64.
b) Right of set-off is not blocked by the moratorium.

Power of Court to restrain proceedings, etc., against company
64.—(1)  Where a company proposes, or intends to propose, a compromise or an arrangement between the company and its creditors or any class of those creditors, the Court may, on the application of the company, make one or more of the following orders, each of which is in force for such period as the Court thinks fit:
(a)an order restraining the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the company;(b)an order restraining the appointment of a receiver or manager over any property or undertaking of the company;(c)an order restraining the commencement or continuation of any proceedings (other than proceedings under section 210 or 212 of the Companies Act, or this section or section 66, 69 or 70) against the company, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;(d)an order restraining the commencement, continuation or levying of any execution, distress or other legal process against any property of the company, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;(e)an order restraining the taking of any step to enforce any security over any property of the company, or to repossess any goods held by the company under any chattels leasing agreement, hirepurchase agreement or retention of title agreement, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;(f)an order restraining the enforcement of any right of reentry or forfeiture under any lease in respect of any premises occupied by the company (including any enforcement pursuant to section 18 or 18A of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap. 61)), except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.
(2)  REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATION FOR MORATORIUM – The company may make the application under subsection (1) only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)no order has been made and no resolution has been passed for the winding up of the company; 
--> i.e. CANNOT APPLY FOR AUTOMATIC INTERIM MORATORIUM ONCE RESOLUTION FOR WINDING UP HAS PASSED(b)the company makes, or undertakes to the Court to make as soon as practicable —
(i)an application under section 210(1) of the Companies Act for the Court to order to be summoned a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors in relation to the compromise or arrangement mentioned in subsection (1); or(ii)an application under section 71(1) to approve the compromise or arrangement mentioned in subsection (1);(c)the company does not make an application under section 210(10) of the Companies Act.

(4)  The company must file the following with the Court together with the application under subsection (1):
(a)evidence of support from the company’s creditors for the intended or proposed compromise or arrangement, together with an explanation of how such support would be important for the success of the intended or proposed compromise or arrangement;(b)in a case where the company has not proposed the compromise or arrangement to the creditors or class of creditors yet, a brief description of the intended compromise or arrangement, containing sufficient particulars to enable the Court to assess whether the intended compromise or arrangement is feasible and merits consideration by the company’s creditors when a statement mentioned in section 211(1)(a) of the Companies Act or section 71(3)(a) relating to the intended compromise or arrangement is placed before those creditors;(c)a list of every secured creditor of the company;(d)a list of all unsecured creditors who are not related to the company or, if there are more than 20 such unsecured creditors, a list of the 20 such unsecured creditors whose claims against the company are the largest among all such unsecured creditors.(5)  An order of the Court under subsection (1) —
(a)may be made subject to such terms as the Court imposes; and(b)may be expressed to apply to any act of any person in Singapore or within the jurisdiction of the Court, whether the act takes place in Singapore or elsewhere. --> CAN RESTRAIN ACTS OUTSIDE SINGAPORE
…
(7)  The Court may make an order extending the period for which an order under subsection (1) is in force, if an application for the extension of the period is made by the company before the expiry of that period.
(8)  Subject to subsection (9), during the automatic moratorium period for an application under subsection (1) by a company — --> EFFECT OF AUTOMATIC MORATORIUM PERIOD
(a)no order may be made, and no resolution may be passed, for the winding up of the company;(b)no receiver or manager may be appointed over any property or undertaking of the company;(c)no proceedings (other than proceedings under section 210 or 212 of the Companies Act, or this section or section 66, 69 or 70) may be commenced or continued against the company, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;(d)no execution, distress or other legal process may be commenced, continued or levied against any property of the company, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;(e)no step may be taken to enforce any security over any property of the company, or to repossess any goods under any chattels leasing agreement, hirepurchase agreement or retention of title agreement, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes; and(f)despite sections 18 and 18A of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, no right of reentry or forfeiture under any lease in respect of any premises occupied by the company may be enforced, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.
(9)  Subsection (8) [I.E. AUTOMATIC INTERIM MORATORIUM] does not apply to a company that makes an application under subsection (1) if, within the period of 12 months immediately before the date on which that application is made, the company made an earlier application under subsection (1) to which subsection (8) applied. 
--> AUTOMATIC INTERIM MORATORIUM WILL ONLY APPLY IF THE APPLICANT COMPANY HAD NOT MADE A S 64 APPLICATION WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS
(10)  The company, any creditor of the company, or any receiver and manager of the whole (or substantially the whole) of the property or undertaking of the company, may apply to the Court for —
(a)an order discharging or varying any order made under subsection (1); or(b)an order that subsection (8), or any paragraph of that subsection that is specified in the order, does not apply to the company starting on the date of the order.
(11)  The Court must grant an application under subsection (10) by a creditor of a company, or by a receiver and manager of the whole (or substantially the whole) of the property or undertaking of a company, if the company failed to comply with subsection (4) when making the application under subsection (1) for the order under subsection (1), and the Court may impose such terms when granting the application under subsection (10) as the Court thinks fit.
(12)  Neither an order made by the Court under subsection (1) nor subsection (8) affects —
(a)the exercise of any legal right under any arrangement (including a setoff arrangement or a netting arrangement) that may be prescribed by regulations; or(b)the commencement or continuation of any proceedings that may be prescribed by regulations.
…
(14)  In this section —
“automatic moratorium period”, in relation to an application under subsection (1), means the period starting on the date on which the application is made, and ending on the earlier of the following:
(a)a date that is 30 days after the date on which the application is made;(b)the date on which the application is decided by the Court;
“chattels leasing agreement”, “hire-purchase agreement” and “retention of title agreement” have the meanings given by section 88(1).
9. Automatic protection arises upon application under s 64 IRDA rather than order
a) This is a subset of the moratorium that is automatic, no need for a court order.

b) An automatic interim moratorium arises on the application for a moratorium (s 64(8), IRDA [s 211B(8), CA]), which would last for 30 days or when the court hears and decides the application (s 64(14)). 

c) This may be followed by a court-ordered moratorium. (s 64(1))
i) Rule: A company may apply for a moratorium at the same time as it applies to court for orders to convene meeting(s) of creditors (i.e. first hearing) or earlier. It may apply when it intends to propose a SOA with its creditors or any class of them: s 64(1) IRDA.

ii) Pre-requisites: The company may apply for the moratorium only if all the conditions in s 64(2) IRDA are satisfied.
(1) no order/resolution for winding up against the company.
(2) the company makes, or undertakes to make, an application for a SOA as soon as practicable.
(3) the company does not make an application for a stay of proceedings under s 210(10), CA. 

iii) Requirements for documents / evidence (s 64(4) IRDA): 
(1) e.g. evidence of creditor support for the scheme, 
(2) where a scheme is not yet proposed, a brief description of the proposed scheme with sufficient particulars

AUTOMATIC INTERIM MORATORIUM WILL ONLY APPLY IF THE APPLICANT COMPANY HAD NOT MADE A S 64 APPLICATION WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS! (S 64(9) IRDA)

d) Scope of automatic interim moratorium (s 64(1)(a) IRDA): a stay against legal and enforcement by creditors
o In appropriate cases, the moratorium may be extended to prohibit acts of creditors outside Singapore (s 64(5)(a) IRDA)
o Does not affect rights under prescribed set-off or netting arrangements

10. Interpretation similar to CA provision on moratorium – Re IM Skaugen [2019] 3 SLR 979 
a) Interpretation: Where a company has proposed a compromise or arrangement, ss 64(4)(a) and (b) applied disjunctively (the support relates to support for the moratorium, not the proposed scheme (at [50])) (at [48]-[54]). In interpreting what constituted evidence of creditor support, case law on s 210(10) CA is relevant. 
b) Test for sufficient particulars: Best served by applying the s 210(10) CA test with modifications – “It sufficed that the proposal contained sufficient particularity for the court to make a broad assessment that there was a reasonable prospect of the scheme working and being acceptable to the general run of creditors” (at [35]) 
i) The court should “refrain from undertaking a vote count, restricting itself to making a broad assessment as to the feasibility of the compromise and its acceptability to the creditors”. “when analysing the support from the creditors, the quality of the support is important.” Thus, “if significant or crucial creditors were supportive, that would be a material consideration.” (at [58])

11. Other points
a) s 64(7): Duration of Court-Ordered Moratorium 
i) The initial automatic moratorium has a 30-day limit, but the court-order moratorium has effectively no time limits: even if the court may practically give a limit, there is no limit on extension under s 64(7). The burden will fall on the courts to strike a proper balance between creditor protection and promoting the expediency of insolvency proceedings. 

b) s 64(5): Extra Territorial Effect
i) Under IRDA an order may be expressed to apply to any act of any person in Singapore or within the jurisdiction of the Court, whether the act takes place in Singapore or elsewhere. The moratorium is not extra-territorial, but rather it is in personam jurisdiction and similar to injunctive relief in anti-suit injunction (Re IM Skaugen). 

c) Variation/ Discharge 
i) The company or its creditor or receiver can apply for a discharge or variation of both moratoriums (s 64(10)) and this must be granted if the company failed to file all documents required by s 64(4) (s 64(11)). 

d) Limits: Set-off arrangement
i) s 64(12): Neither the court-ordered moratorium nor the automatic moratorium affects the exercise of any legal right under any arrangement (including a set off arrangement or a netting arrangement) that may be prescribed by regulations made under s 411. 

5.3 *Creditor’s Meeting
12. Recall – meeting is called by application by an interested party in CA s 210(1)-(2).
5.3.1 *Disclosure requirements
13. After leave is granted to convene creditors’ meeting: Notice and Disclosure Requirements
a) Starting point: s 211(1)(a) CA – statement about director’s interests.

211.—(1)  Where a meeting is summoned under section 210, there must —
(a)with every notice summoning the meeting which is sent to a creditor, member or holder of units of shares of the company — be sent also a statement explaining the effect of the compromise or arrangement and in particular stating any material interests of the directors, whether as directors or as members, creditors or holders of units of shares of the company or otherwise, and the effect thereon of the compromise or arrangement in so far as it is different from the effect on the like interests of other persons; and(b)in every notice summoning the meeting which is given by advertisement — be included either such a statement or a notification of the place at which and the manner in which creditors, members or holders of units of shares of the company entitled to attend the meeting may obtain copies of such a statement.
b) Notice of meeting and explanatory statement must be sent to creditors

c) Explanatory statement must:
i) explain nature of scheme
ii) state any material interests of company’s directors and shareholders
iii) contain full and fair disclosure of information reasonably necessary to enable recipients to determine how to vote
 
14. Level of Disclosure for application for leave vs at creditor’s meeting – Pathfinder Strategic Credit 
a) Generally, more disclosure at creditor’s meeting.

b) Application for leave, is a relatively early stage in the restructuring process. *No need for a finalised restructuring plan at the leave stage and the company need only present a proposal with “sufficient particulars”. 

c) Distinction: 
i) At the application for meeting stage, the applicant must provide sufficient material before the courts for an informed decision to be made as to how the creditors’ meeting is to be conducted, which is a less onerous standard of disclosure. 
ii) In comparison, at the voting stage, not only must s 211 CA be complied with, but **more detailed information is required to ensure that the creditors will be able to exercise their voting rights meaningfully. 

d) Provision of explanatory statement to the court: Although the language of s 211(1) suggests that the explanatory statement need only be sent to the creditors after the court has granted leave under s 210(1), it is now common practice that it is provided to the court at the leave stage in support of the leave application. 

15. *Classification of creditors – TT International.
a) Principle: Applicant’s responsibility to decide on classification and to notify persons.
o The company must unreservedly disclose all material information to the court to assist it in arriving at a properly considered determination on how the scheme creditors’ meeting is to be conducted
o Any issues in relation to the possible need for separate meetings for different classes of creditors ought to be unambiguously brought to the attention of the court hearing the application

b) **TEST: Creditors to be divided into separate classes if “their rights are so dissimilar (i.e. different) that they cannot sensibly consult together with a view to their common interest”. [dissimilarity principle]
i) The dissimilarity test is based on dissimilarity of legal rights against the company, not the dissimilarity of interests as distinct from such legal rights.
ii) Minor variance is acceptable.
iii) This is a method of minority protection by letting them vote separately.

c) Possible classes:
i) Secured creditors
ii) Creditors with priority and preferential claims and are receiving payment in full compared to those receiving payment in part.
iii) Unsecured creditors.
iv) Creditors whose claims are subordinated in liquidation.
v) What about unsecured creditors and contingent creditors? Court in TT International held that contingent creditors will be treated the same as unsecured creditors.

In our view, the contingent creditors’ legal rights as against the Respondent (and relative to the other creditors) were the same under the Scheme as they were in an insolvent liquidation. Therefore, it seemed to us that these contingent creditors would assess the Scheme primarily based on its effectiveness in preserving the Respondent’s economic value (so as to satisfy their claims), as the rest of the creditors in the general class of unsecured creditors would. In that light, we saw no reason to classify those contingent creditors separately. It cannot be overlooked that the separate classification of any group of creditors allows that group a minority veto and courts must be careful not to allow the test for classification to become “an instrument of oppression by a minority”.

If a creditor’s (or a group of creditors’) position will improve or decline to such a different extent vis-à-vis other creditors simply because of the terms of the scheme (and not because of its own unique circumstances, i.e., its “private interests”) assessed against the most likely scenario in the absence of scheme approval (“the appropriate comparator”), then it should be placed in a different voting class from the other creditors.

Ultimately, the classification of creditors for the purposes of voting is protective of minority creditors whose rights might be crammed down upon if they are outvoted. By allowing them to vote separately from creditors whose rights are so different from them such that the latter have additional non-private interests in voting for the scheme, these minority creditors are less likely to be overwhelmed and their votes are given the appropriate significance. The application of the dissimilarity principle to complex transactions and situations where there are different levels of secured and unsecured creditors, as well as intra-creditor relationships, is not without its difficulties. Defining a “legal right” in these contexts can be thorny. The courts have therefore to take a broad, practical and objective approach in analysing creditor relationships and ensure that the application of this principle does not lead to an impractical mushrooming of classes that could potentially result in the creation of unjustified minority vetoes. An overly legalistic approach might inhibit the usage of schemes as a practical alternative to other insolvency measures with more extreme consequences for creditors as a whole.

5.3.2 *Voting
16. Key steps before scheme becomes binding
a) Application made to Court that one or more meetings of creditors be summoned (s 210(1) CA)

b) VOTING: Proposed scheme is put before the meeting(s) of creditors for consideration and approved by requisite majority (s 210(3AB) CA)
i) Majority in number of 
(1) Creditors or each class of creditors; or
(2) Members or class of members; or
(3) Holders of units of shares or class of holders of units of shares,
ii) **Here, majority means a majority in number (i.e. more than 50%) of creditors representing three-fourths (i.e. holding at least 75%) in value within the same class present and voting. 
iii) Can be in person or by proxy.

c) If proposal approved by requisite majority, court may sanction the scheme (s 210(3AB) and (4) CA)

d) Copy of the Order sanctioning the scheme must be lodged with the Registrar (s 210(5) CA)

17. Extra issues
a) Genuine assignment of debts – SK Engineering & Construction v Conchubar Aromatics 
i) Court needs to be satisfied that assignments of debts were “genuine and also made at arms’ length” (at [82]), as otherwise creditors may seek to circumvent the headcount test in s 210(3AB)(a) by assigning debts to parties who would vote in line with them 
ii) Problem with numbers: Can try to artificially blow up the number. Can try to assign the debt to many creditors – instead of having 1 creditor holding 1 mil worth of debt, can have 10 creditors collectively holding 1 mil. Can play around with majority in number requirement. Can do share splitting 
b) Related party votes to be excluded
i) Should be discounted – TT International [2012]:
(1) Votes of wholly owned subsidiaries of scheme company should be discounted to zero. The reason is that they are entirely controlled by their parent company.
(2) Votes of related creditors which were not wholly-owned subsidiaries may be partially discounted (due to their special interests to support the proposed scheme by virtue of their relationship to the company) (at [155])
ii) Only full discount – SK Engineering & Construction v Conchubar Aromatics [2017]:
(1) The SGCA, in dicta, expressed reservations about the partial discounting approach. 
(a) No jurisdiction has made such a suggestion.
(b) Counsel were unable to proffer a clear and principled method of determining the appropriate discount to apply
(c) The exercise of determining an appropriate partial discount is inevitably arbitrary and subjective, and not amenable to definitive guidance.
(2) The CA concluded that a more principled and certain approach is to wholly discount the votes of creditors once they are found to be related to the scheme company: if the position of a creditor is in any way tainted, it should follow that that creditor’s votes on the scheme should be entirely disregarded.
5.3.3 Court’s other powers
18.  Court’s power to cram down minority classes – s 70 IRDA.
a) Court can still make the scheme binding even if requisite majority not reached.
b) s 70(2): the court has power to cram down one or more dissenting class of creditors if the conditions in s 70(1) and (3) are satisfied.
c) Requirements:
i) At least one approving class – s 70(1)
ii) Requisite approval (3/4) from creditors meant to be bound by scheme overall – s 70(3)
iii) No unfair discrimination between 2 or more classes of creditors – s 70(3)
iv) Scheme is fair and equitable to each dissenting class – s 70(3)

19. Power of court to approve scheme of arrangement without creditors’ meeting – s 71 IRDA

Power of Court to approve compromise or arrangement without meeting of creditors
71.—(1)  Despite section 210 of the Companies Act but subject to this section, where a compromise or an arrangement is proposed between a company and its creditors or any class of those creditors, the Court may, on an application made by the company, make an order approving the compromise or arrangement, even though no meeting of the creditors or class of creditors has been ordered under section 210(1) of that Act or held.
(2)  Subject to subsection (10), if the compromise or arrangement is approved by order of the Court under subsection (1), the compromise or arrangement is binding on the company and the creditors or class of creditors meant to be bound by the compromise or arrangement.
(3)  The Court must not approve a compromise or an arrangement under subsection (1) unless —
(a)the company has provided each creditor meant to be bound by the compromise or arrangement with a statement that complies with subsection (6) and contains the following information:
(i)information concerning the company’s property, assets, business activities, financial condition and prospects;(ii)information on the manner in which the terms of the compromise or arrangement will, if it takes effect, affect the rights of the creditor;(iii)such other information as is necessary to enable the creditor to make an informed decision whether to agree to the compromise or arrangement;(b)the company has published a notice of the application under subsection (1) in the Gazette and in at least one English local daily newspaper, and has sent a copy of the notice published in the Gazette to the Registrar of Companies;(c)the company has sent a notice and a copy of the application under subsection (1) to each creditor meant to be bound by the compromise or arrangement; and(d)the Court is satisfied that had a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors been summoned, the conditions in section 210(3AB)(a) and (b) of the Companies Act (insofar as they relate to the creditors or class of creditors) would have been satisfied.
(4)  Despite subsection (3)(c), the company may, if directed by the Court, give notice of the application under subsection (1) to the creditors or class of creditors in such manner as the Court may direct.
(5)  The Court may grant its approval of a compromise or an arrangement subject to such alterations or conditions as the Court thinks just.
(6)  The statement mentioned in subsection (3)(a) must —
(a)explain the effect of the compromise or arrangement and, in particular, state —
(i)any material interests of the directors of the company (whether as directors or as members, creditors or holders of units of shares of the company or otherwise); and(ii)the effect that the compromise or arrangement has on those interests, insofar as that effect is different from the effect that the compromise or arrangement has on the like interests of other persons; and(b)where the compromise or arrangement affects the rights of debenture holders, contain the like explanation with respect to the trustees for the debenture holders as, under paragraph (a), the statement is required to give with respect to the directors of the company.
(7)  Each director, and each trustee for debenture holders, must give notice to the company of such matters relating to the director or trustee as may be necessary for the purposes of subsection (6) within 7 days after the director or trustee receives a request in writing from the company for information as to such matters.
(8)  Any director of a company or trustee for debenture holders who contravenes subsection (7) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.
(9)  A person, being a director of a company or a trustee for debenture holders, is not guilty of an offence under subsection (8), if the person shows that the person’s contravention of subsection (7) was due to the refusal of another director of the company or trustee for debenture holders to supply to the person the particulars of the person’s material interests affected by the compromise or arrangement.
(10)  Unless the Court orders otherwise, an order made under subsection (1) —
(a)has no effect until a copy of the order is lodged with the Registrar of Companies; and(b)takes effect starting on the date of the lodgment.

a) General idea
i) Under s 71(1), a court may, on a company’s application, approve a scheme even though no scheme meeting(s) of the creditors has been ordered or held, provided that the conditions in s 71(3) are satisfied:
(1) the company has given the requisite information to each creditor meant to be bound by the scheme (‘relevant creditor’); 
(2) notified each relevant creditor of the application and given publicity of the application; and 
(3) the court is satisfied that had the meeting of the relevant creditors been summoned, the requisite majorities approving the meeting would have been satisfied.  
ii) Cram down of a dissenting class is thus not available to a pre-pack scheme.
iii) No need for creditors’ meeting does not mean creditors don’t need to vote
b) Information to be given to creditors – 
i) S 73(3), (6).
c) Satisfactory evidence of creditors’ consent – Re DSG Asia Holdings Pte Ltd [2021] SGHC 209
i) The court refused to sanction the pre-pack on two grounds: inadequate disclosure (at [43]), and erroneous classification of a creditor, Allington (at [74])    
ii) The two reasons are not unique to pre-packs. They apply similarly to full-fledged schemes.
iii) Court’s statement on the utility and limitations of pre-packs:
(1) “the expedition and procedural simplicity granted by the s 71 framework should generally be used only for clear cases of agreement to pre-arranged schemes.” 
(2) “Where a major creditor objects or the scheme company has difficulty providing information, that is a strong signal that the s 71 process should not be utilised and is probably unavailable. In that situation, the company should use the normal procedure in s 210 of the Companies Act and have matters resolved through actual meetings and voting by creditors.” (at [27])
iv) Court held that applicants for a pre-pack scheme will only need to establish a clear case that (1) there was proper disclosure; and (2) there was fulfilment of the voting requirements (at [31]). As the statutory framework was meant to expedite matters for the applicant, “A stricter approach may be unduly narrow” (at [31])
 
20.  Creation of an administrative convenience class – Re Zipmex Co Ltd [2022] SGHC 306
a) Applicants sought to group unsecured creditors with low debt values as a separate “administrative convenience class”, “with the objective of reducing the burden on the restructuring company by grouping separately low value creditors.” (at [6])
b) Abdullah J did not create the administrative convenience class as he had 2 concerns: 
i) Unclear juridical basis for the Court to entertain such an application (at [7]), and 
ii) The framework in s 71 “does not appear to contemplate any role for the Court before the application is put forward.” (at [8])
c) However, he noted that he was “not rejecting the concept of an administrative convenience class, as such.” (at [9])
i) “Should the issue be raised in an application under s 71, as presently advised, I would not think that the creation of an administrative convenience class is necessarily antithetical to the statutory framework, even in the absence of an express provision […] What will be important […] in weighing whether such an administrative convenience class may be properly adopted in a pre-packaged scheme of arrangement are how the various interests are balanced, what trade-offs are incurred, and what safeguards are put in place.” (at [9])

5.4 Court Approval of Scheme
21. After obtaining requisite majority in voting, Court must sanction the scheme – s 210(3AB)(c) CA 
5.4.1 *What the Court considers when approving SOA
22. *Conditions for Court to Sanction Scheme of Arrangement – TT International notes 3 issues.
a) Jurisdiction: The statutory provisions have been complied with, for e.g., that the resolution is passed by the requisite majority at meeting(s) duly convened.
b) Fair representation & minority protection: Those who attended the meeting were fairly representative of the class of creditors, and that the statutory majority did not coerce the minority in order to promote interests adverse to those of the class whom the statutory majority purported to represent.
c) Reasonableness: The scheme is one which a man of business or an intelligent and honest man, being a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his interest, would reasonably approve.

23. Fairness as overarching consideration – Re Conchubar Aromatics Ltd [2017] 3 SLR 748
a) [24]: “The overarching consideration of a court asked to sanction a proposed scheme was whether the proposed scheme was a fair one. […] 
b) Fairness requires that creditors who would be affected by the proposed scheme in similar ways (at least in so far as the enforcement of their legal rights against the company was concerned) must be afforded a proper opportunity to be present at the meeting(s) at which the proposal was to be considered and to indicate their choice by casting their votes. 
c) The law recognised that creditors were normally the best judges of what was in their commercial interests, and that it would not be fair for the intentions of the majority who had assessed a proposed scheme as best serving their interests to be frustrated by the views of a minority which happened to have a different commercial sense. 
d) This assumed, however, that the majority, in casting their votes, exercised independent, objective judgment with their commercial interests as creditors of the class as their primary consideration, as otherwise, their vote would not be representative of the class.” 

24. Sufficient Disclosure (not asterisked)
a) Wah Yuen Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v Singapore Cables Manufacturers Pte Ltd [2003] 3 SLR(R) 629: The SGCA refused to sanction scheme due to lack of transparency on how related company debts were incurred; creditors were also not given information on whether the returns under the proposed scheme were in fact greater than what they would expect in a liquidation. 
b) Re Econ Corp Ltd [2004] 1 SLR(R) 273: Information on finances of company and parent company were withheld and the creditors were unable to decide if the returns under the scheme of arrangement was in fact greater than what would have been recovered in liquidation. 
c) Re Horizon Knowledge Solutions Pte Ltd [2004] SGHC 270: information on accounts and related creditors’ debts was withheld

25. Sanction may be Subject to Conditions – The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v. Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd [2008] 3 SLR(R) 121
a) Court may grant its approval “subject to such alterations or conditions as it thinks just”.
b) SGCA held that the discretion under s 210(4) is a broad discretion that allows the court to modify a scheme, circumscribed only by what it deems just. 
c) However, “if the court proposes to make an amendment that would result in a substantive rather than […] a procedural change, [it] would in all likelihood refer the proposed change back to the scheme manager and the company’s creditors or members for further consideration.” (at [43])
5.4.2 Effect of Court Order
26. All parties to the scheme are bound, including dissenting creditors – The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd [2008] 3 SLR (R) 121
a) Timing: A Court order approving the compromise or arrangement has no effect until a copy of the order is lodged with the Registrar, and upon being so lodged, the order shall take effect on and from the date of lodgment or such earlier date as the Court may determine and as may be specified in the order (s 210(5), CA).
5.4.3 Effect of scheme on third parties
27. General idea 
a) General rule: “a scheme of arrangement or compromise made between a company and its creditors and sanctioned by the court affected only the rights of the creditors against the company and did not affect the rights of the creditors against a third party” (Eltraco at [26]) 
b) But can express clauses affect rights against third parties?
i) Situation in Daewoo is that the 3P is the guarantor for the company. 
ii) Can the SOA release the obligations of the guarantor, who is not party to it?
c) In Daewoo, SGCA held yes – no reason why not.

28. Rights against 3P can be affected, if sufficient nexus – Pathfinder Strategic Credit LP v Empire Credit Resources Pte Ltd [2019] 2 SLR 77
a) Facts
i) The debtor-company (BCR), an individual borrowing company within the group (BCE), had to do two schemes, one for the 2015 and another 2017 notes, but this was not possible for want of the requisite majority. Hence, the suggestion was to have the guarantor propose the scheme to reduce the debt – this is a strategic move: wanted Empire Capital (EC) as common guarantor of the 2015 and 2017 notes to treat the notes as one group of creditors and thereby obtain the requisite majority. 
ii) In this application by EC as guarantor of the notes, it proposed putting all noteholders in single class. Under the terms, the notes will be cancelled, and the liabilities of BCR, BCE and co-guarantors will be waived. BC will issue new notes. 
iii) Minority creditor argued that only third party releases that are necessary to give effect to the proposed scheme may be compromised.
b) CA rejected argument. 
c) Test is whether there is a sufficient nexus or connection between the release of the third-party liability and the relationship between the company and the scheme creditors.

5.5 Termination of SOA
29. Scheme document will set out termination events, which may include:
a) Duration
b) Occurrence of events of default
c) Final payment or distribution made to creditors and full implementation of scheme
d) Vote at a meeting of creditors or on decision of the scheme manager


6 *CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY
The only section asterisked is the winding up of foreign companies

1. Winding Up of Foreign Companies
a) Refer Part 10 Division 1 IRDA – Winding up of unregistered companies (Part 8 and 9 of IRDA – winding up), BUT NOT JM (Part 7 IRDA) or SCHEME OF ARRANGEMENT (Part 5 IRDA)
i) “unregistered company” means foreign companies.
ii) S 245-249.

b) Jurisdiction of the Singapore Courts – s 246(1)(d) IRDA
i) ONLY if it has a substantial connection with Singapore.
ii) Or substantial nexus.

c) Factors in deciding whether there is substantial connection (s 246(3) IRDA):
i) Singapore is the centre of main interests of the company;
ii) The company is carrying on business in Singapore or has a place of business in Singapore;
iii) The company is a foreign company that is registered under Div 2 of Part XI Companies Act;
iv) The company has substantial assets in Singapore;
v) The company has chosen Singapore law as the law governing a loan or other transaction, or the law governing the resolution of one or more disputes arising out of or in connection with a loan or other transaction;
vi) The company has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts for the resolution of one or more disputes relating to a loan or other transaction.
 
2. Case Law
a) Re Griffin Securities Corp [1999] 1 SLR(R) 219 at [17]: The foreign company (Griffin) “had the major part of its assets and had had extensive business operations in Singapore”, and hence, “a sufficient nexus existed between Griffin and Singapore to justify the making of a winding-up order by a Singapore court.” 
b) Re Projector SA [2009] 2 SLR(R) 151: There was evidence of a “significant connection” between the foreign company and Singapore (at [35]). The company had business operations in Singapore and until recently (2008) had registered with ACRA as a foreign company (at [35]). It’s significant that the company deregistered 2 days after a statutory demand was served, and thus the court held that this was “a misguided attempt to evade this court’s winding-up jurisdiction over it.” (at [35]) Furthermore, the foreign company had a close connection with Singapore companies by way of owning shares in them and by having close working links with them (at [38])

3. Administration of a liquidation of a foreign company which has been wound up or dissolved in its place of incorporation (i.e. liquidation proceedings in both Singapore and the foreign country)
a) For certain types of foreign companies (defined as “relevant companies”), the liquidator must first pay debts incurred in Singapore before the company’s assets can be transmitted to the principal liquidation in its place of incorporation
b) No “ring fencing” of assets in Singapore, except for certain types of companies (s250(3)(c) IRDA)

6.1 UNCITRAL Model Law (Third Schedule IRDA)
4. Model Law provides the platform for recognition of and assistance to foreign insolvency process

5. Platform for:
a) Granting access to foreign insolvency office holders (e.g. liquidator) to the courts of the enacting state (i.e. Singapore)
b) Recognition by the enacting state of the foreign insolvency proceedings
c) Granting of relief to assist the foreign insolvency proceedings
d) Cooperation and coordination between courts and insolvency appointment holders of different states
NB: there is no requirement of reciprocity (does not matter if the foreign insolvency proceeding is taking place in a country which has not adopted the Model Law) 

6. Nature and extent of recognition and assistance depends on whether the foreign liquidator was appointed in the company’s Centre of Main Interests (COMI)
a) determines whether a foreign proceeding is a: 
i) foreign main proceeding (Art 2(f) Model Law), OR
ii) foreign non-main proceeding.

b) Rebuttable presumption that the debtor’s registered office is its COMI (Art 16(3) Model Law)

c) In essence, the COMI is the nerve centre of the company, but mainly depends on the facts and the evidence of how a COMI is established (Zetta Jet; Rooftop Group)

7. Significance of foreign main vs non-main proceeding:
a) Determines whether the reliefs to be granted by the local courts are automatic or discretionary

b) Foreign main proceeding (a proceeding taking place in a country where the debtor has COMI) – then reliefs like (i) stay against proceedings and execution in Singapore, and (ii) no transfer of assets, would be automatic and mandatory --> SG courts have less power to intervene
o Stay and suspension do NOT affect steps taken to enforce security rights over the debtor’s property, re-possess goods under a hire purchase agreement and a creditor’s rights of set-off (Art 20(3) Model Law)

c) Foreign non-main proceeding (where debtor has no COMI, but an establishment – place of operation where debtor carries out a non-transitory economic activity)– then powers and reliefs are subject to discretion of the Singapore courts --> SG courts have more power

d) Regardless of main or non-main, it is open to the debtor to seek other reliefs, e.g. examination of witnesses, taking of evidence or delivery of information relating to debtor’s assets, affairs, rights or obligations

8. In granting relief, courts must be satisfied that the interests of the creditors (including secured creditors) and other interests persons, including the debtor, are adequately protected (Art 22 Model Law)

9. Invoking Singapore processes in conjunction with cross-border restructuring
a) The Model Law is purely procedural and does not provide for the restructuring of the company’s debts and liabilities (e.g. assists foreign liquidation proceedings by ordering a stay against proceedings in Singapore)
b) To do so, a foreign company needs to initiate a scheme of arrangement or judicial management process in Singapore
i) For SOA: the foreign company must be liable to be wound up in Singapore – and thus must have a substantial connection to Singapore (see above) (s 63(3) IRDA; s 210(11) CA)
ii) For JM: the foreign company must be a “corporation liable to be wound up” under the IRDA (definition of “company” in s 88 IRDA) – thus there must also be a substantial connection to Singapore. However, the Singapore courts may also consider other factors in deciding whether to grant the judicial management order. E.g. Deutsche Bank v APP where the JM application was dismissed because among other things, it was uncertain if the judicial managers will be able to control key foreign subsidiaries and achieve the objectives for which they were appointed
