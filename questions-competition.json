    "question": "Five major supermarket chains in Singapore (Chain A, B, C, D, and E) have been under investigation by the CCCS for potential anti-competitive conduct. The investigation revealed that: (1) Chain A and B agreed to fix the price of fresh chicken at S$8.50 per kg, (2) Chain C attended meetings with A and B but claims it never implemented the agreed prices, (3) Chain D received price information from Chain A but did not respond, and (4) Chain E independently raised its prices to S$8.50 per kg after seeing the others' prices. The CCCS is determining liability under section 34 of the Competition Act. Which of the following statements about liability may apply?",
    "statements": [
      "I. Only Chain A and B are liable as they were the only ones who explicitly agreed to fix prices.",
      "II. Chain C is liable as it attended the meetings and is presumed to have participated in the concerted practice.",
      "III. Chain D is liable as it received price information from Chain A, creating a presumption of concerted practice.",
      "IV. Chain E is not liable as it acted independently without any communication with other chains.",
      "V. All chains except Chain E are liable as they were all part of the same anti-competitive arrangement."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "**Statement I (INCORRECT):** This oversimplifies the law. Liability under section 34 extends beyond explicit agreements to include concerted practices. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Chain C is liable as attending meetings creates a presumption of participation in concerted practice under the Anic presumption. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Chain D is liable as receiving price information creates a presumption of concerted practice, even without reciprocal exchange. **Statement IV (INCORRECT):** Chain E's independent action doesn't create liability, but the statement is wrong about the overall liability assessment. **Statement V (CORRECT):** Chains A, B, C, and D are all liable as they were part of the same anti-competitive arrangement through agreements and concerted practices.",

    "question": "PharmaCorp Ltd is the dominant supplier of a critical vaccine in Singapore, holding 70% market share. The company has recently engaged in the following conduct: (1) Refused to supply the vaccine to a new entrant, MedStart Pte Ltd, citing capacity constraints, (2) Offered exclusive supply agreements to hospitals with discounts of 30% if they agree not to purchase from competitors, (3) Predatorily priced the vaccine at below cost for 6 months to drive out a competitor, and (4) Tied the sale of the vaccine to the purchase of other pharmaceutical products. The CCCS is investigating potential abuse of dominant position under section 47. Which of the following statements about the conduct may apply?",
    "statements": [
      "I. The refusal to supply constitutes abuse of dominant position as it prevents market entry and restricts competition.",
      "II. The exclusive supply agreements with discounts are permissible as they provide benefits to consumers through lower prices.",
      "III. The predatory pricing constitutes abuse as it is designed to eliminate competitors and maintain dominance.",
      "IV. The tying arrangement constitutes abuse as it leverages dominance in one market to gain advantage in another market.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** Refusal to supply by a dominant firm can constitute abuse if it prevents market entry and restricts competition. **Statement II (INCORRECT):** Exclusive supply agreements with discounts can constitute abuse if they foreclose competitors from the market, even if they provide short-term benefits to consumers. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Predatory pricing is a classic form of abuse designed to eliminate competitors and maintain dominance. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Tying arrangements can constitute abuse when they leverage dominance in one market to gain advantage in another market. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** While most conduct constitutes abuse, the exclusive supply agreements need further analysis to determine if they have anti-competitive effects.",
