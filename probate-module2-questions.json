      "question": "Testator's will states: 'I give the Goodwood Property to my wife for her personal use during her lifetime as her personal residence.' The wife argues she has a proprietary life interest in the property entitling her to sell it or mortgage it. The trustees argue she has only a personal license to reside. Applying Zhao Hui Fang, which of the following is correct?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The wife has a proprietary life interest and can deal with the property as she wishes during her lifetime.",
        "B": "The wife has only a personal right to reside (license) with no proprietary or ownership interest.",
        "C": "The wife has a beneficial interest suspended during her lifetime with full ownership transferring at her death.",
        "D": "The construction depends on which interpretation is more favorable to the wife."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The wife has only a personal license to reside, not a proprietary interest. In Zhao Hui Fang v Commissioner of Stamp Duties [2017] 4 SLR 945, the court at [46] held that the testator's intention (derived from the will's wording) was that 'Mdm Zhao was a mere licensee with a personal right to reside in the Goodwood Property rent-free; the Will confers no proprietary or ownership interest on her. Specifically, the legal interest in the property remains vested in the trustees of the Foundation, and... the beneficial interest is suspended.' At [51], the court focused on the words 'personal use during her lifetime,' 'as her personal residence,' 'for her use' and 'the use of any one or more of her children' as indicating 'only... Mdm Zhao's personal right to reside on the property, and are inconsistent with proprietary rights or a proprietary life interest.' At [54], the court found the intention was 'at best that the property can \"be used as a family home for Mdm Zhao and their children.\"' Here, the will uses similar language: 'for her personal use during her lifetime as her personal residence.' The words 'personal use' and 'personal residence' suggest a personal right (license) rather than proprietary interest. The wife can live in the property rent-free, but cannot sell, mortgage, or otherwise deal with it as an owner. The legal and beneficial interests remain with the trustees.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because the language 'personal use' and 'personal residence' suggests personal rights, not proprietary interests. The notes from Zhao Hui Fang at [51] explain that words like 'personal use during her lifetime,' 'as her personal residence,' and 'for her use' focus 'only on... the personal right to reside on the property, and are inconsistent with proprietary rights or a proprietary life interest.' A proprietary life interest (life estate) would give the wife ownership rights for her lifetime - she could lease the property to tenants, grant easements, sue for trespass, etc. But she could not sell or destroy the capital (the property itself must be preserved for remaindermen). Here, the will does not create even a life estate - it creates only a license. The distinction is significant: a life tenant has proprietary rights; a licensee has only personal rights. The wife cannot deal with the property, cannot prevent the trustees from dealing with it (subject to her right to reside), and has no proprietary interest that could be assigned or inherited.",
          "C": "This answer correctly identifies that beneficial interest is suspended (from Zhao Hui Fang at [46]), but incorrectly suggests the wife gets 'full ownership' at death. The notes from Zhao Hui Fang state the beneficial interest is suspended during the wife's lifetime, but do not suggest it transfers to the wife at her death. More likely, the beneficial interest remains suspended during her lifetime, and at her death, it vests in the ultimate beneficiaries (perhaps the testator's children or other remaindermen, depending on the will's other provisions). If the wife received full ownership at her death, she would have more than a license - she would have a future proprietary interest. But the court found only a personal license with no proprietary interest. The answer misunderstands what 'suspended beneficial interest' means - it is suspended awaiting vesting in someone else, not suspended until the wife takes absolutely.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because will construction is not based on favorability to beneficiaries but on the testator's intention. The notes from Zhao Hui Fang at [46]-[54] emphasize: 'The issue of whether Mdm Zhao had a proprietary life interest or personal licence to reside turned on the Testator's intention. This had to predominantly be derived from the wording of the Will itself, although the circumstances prevailing at the time of execution of the Will could also be taken into account.' The court's task is to determine the testator's intention from the will's language, not to choose the construction most favorable to any party. Foo Jee Seng at [17] states: 'the overriding aim of the court in construing a will is to seek and give effect to the testamentary intention as expressed by the testator.' This is an objective inquiry based on the will's words, not a subjective preference for one beneficiary. If the construction were based on favorability, courts would always construe wills to maximize benefits to sympathetic beneficiaries, which would undermine the testator's intentions. The answer invents a favorability principle that does not exist."

      "question": "Testator executed a will in 1990 giving 'all my real estate' to his daughter. In 2000, the testator purchased a house using a power of appointment granted to him by a trust. The testator dies in 2023. Does the house purchased with the power of appointment pass to the daughter under the will?",
      "options": {
        "A": "No, because the house is trust property, not the testator's real estate.",
        "B": "Yes, under section 21 Wills Act, because 'all my real estate' includes property the testator has power to appoint.",
        "C": "No, unless the will expressly mentions exercising the power of appointment.",
        "D": "Yes, but only if the power of appointment was a general power allowing appointment to anyone."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Yes, the house passes to the daughter under s 21 Wills Act. The notes state: 'Construction of general gift of property: includes property over which testator has general power of appointment (WA s 21).' Section 21 provides: 'real estate of the testator described in a general manner shall be construed to include any real estate that the testator has power to appoint over in any manner he thinks proper.' Here, the will gives 'all my real estate' - this is a general description of the testator's real estate (not limited to specific properties). The house purchased using a power of appointment is 'real estate that the testator has power to appoint over.' Under s 21, when the will makes a general gift of real estate, it is construed to include property subject to a general power of appointment. Therefore, the house passes to the daughter under the will. Section 21 is a construction rule that expands the meaning of general descriptions to include appointive property, unless the will shows contrary intention. This prevents testators from inadvertently failing to dispose of property over which they have powers of appointment.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 21 Wills Act specifically includes property subject to a power of appointment in general gifts of real estate. While the house may technically be trust property (held under a trust that gave the testator a power of appointment), when the testator makes a general gift of 'all my real estate,' this is construed to include property the testator can appoint. The testator has effective control over who receives the house (through the power of appointment), so functionally, it is similar to the testator's own property. Section 21 recognizes this by including such property in general real estate gifts. If the will gave specific property only ('my house at 123 Main Street'), then appointive property might not be included. But 'all my real estate' is sufficiently general to trigger s 21. The answer incorrectly treats trust property with a power of appointment as excluded from 'real estate.'",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 21 Wills Act operates as a construction rule without requiring express mention of the power. The notes state: 'Section 21: real estate of the testator described in a general manner shall be construed to include any real estate that the testator has power to appoint over in any manner he thinks proper.' The word 'construed' indicates this is a rule of interpretation - the general language 'all my real estate' is interpreted to include appointive property. The testator does not need to specifically mention 'and I hereby exercise my power of appointment' for s 21 to operate. The general gift is sufficient. If express mention were required, many testators would inadvertently fail to dispose of appointive property (because they might not realize technical distinctions between owned property and appointive property). Section 21 avoids this by presuming that general gifts include appointive property. The answer incorrectly requires express exercise of the power.",
          "D": "This answer adds a requirement about the power being 'general' that is partially correct but overstated. Section 21 refers to property 'the testator has power to appoint over in any manner he thinks proper' - this language suggests a general power of appointment (where the testator can appoint to anyone, including himself or his estate) rather than a special power (limited to a class of persons). However, the facts state the testator had 'a power of appointment granted to him by a trust' without specifying whether it is general or special. If it is a general power, s 21 clearly applies. If it is a special power, there might be debate about whether s 21 applies. The notes do not elaborate on this distinction. For exam purposes, the better answer is B, which directly applies s 21 without getting into the general vs. special power distinction. The answer is technically raising a relevant point but may be overcomplicating what appears to be a straightforward s 21 application."

      "question": "Testator and his girlfriend purchased a property together as joint tenants in 2010, each contributing 50% to the purchase price. They registered the property as joint tenants. In 2015, testator's will gives 'my half-share in the property at 456 River Valley Road' to his son. Testator dies in 2023. The girlfriend claims the entire property by right of survivorship. Can the son claim the half-share under the will?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes, because the will effectively severs the joint tenancy, giving the son the testator's half-share.",
        "B": "No, because a will cannot sever a joint tenancy under section 35(1) CLPA, so the entire property passes to the girlfriend by survivorship.",
        "C": "Yes, if the son can prove a resulting trust giving the testator a 50% beneficial interest held as tenant in common.",
        "D": "No, unless the testator executed a deed severing the joint tenancy before death."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The son cannot claim the half-share because a will cannot sever a joint tenancy. The notes state: 'Joint tenancies of immovable property: a will CANNOT sever joint tenancy (s 35(1) CLPA)' and 'Right of survivorship for joint tenancies (Shafeeg) - however, the ultimate survivor CAN dispose of jointly held assets in a will (Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye).' Section 35(1) Civil Law and Property Act provides that joint tenancies cannot be severed by will. The effect of a joint tenancy is that when one joint tenant dies, the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) by operation of the right of survivorship. This occurs by law, not through the deceased's will or intestacy. The deceased's share (if it can be called a share) is extinguished, and the survivor owns the entire property. Here, the testator and girlfriend are joint tenants. When the testator dies, the girlfriend becomes sole owner by survivorship. The will's attempt to give 'my half-share' to the son is ineffective because: (1) there is no 'share' to give (joint tenancy means unity of ownership, not separate shares), and (2) even if conceptualized as a share, it cannot be disposed of by will under s 35(1). The son receives nothing.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is directly contradicted by s 35(1) CLPA. The notes state: 'a will CANNOT sever joint tenancy (s 35(1) CLPA).' If wills could sever joint tenancies, the right of survivorship would be meaningless - every joint tenant could unilaterally defeat survivorship by making a will. The whole point of joint tenancy is that survivorship operates automatically regardless of wills. To sever a joint tenancy, the notes specify: 'Joint tenancy must be severed by: (a) deed (for unregistered land) (CLPA s 66A) or (b) instrument of declaration in approved form (for registered land) (LTA s 53(5)) and (c) serving copy on other joint tenants.' These are specific procedures that must be followed during the testator's lifetime. A will executed without these procedures cannot sever the joint tenancy. Here, there is no evidence of a deed or instrument of declaration severing the joint tenancy. The will alone is ineffective to sever. The answer incorrectly suggests a will can sever joint tenancy.",
          "C": "While the resulting trust concept is relevant to joint bank accounts and could theoretically apply to jointly owned property, it does not help the son here. The notes explain: 'Argue for equitable tenancy in common (i.e. that there was severance) due to resulting trust or constructive trust.' A resulting trust arises 'where a transfer of property to another takes place for which the recipient does not provide the whole of the consideration' (Chan Yuen Lan at [47]). Here, both contributed 50% to the purchase price, so there is no unequal contribution to trigger a resulting trust. Even if there were unequal contribution creating a resulting trust, the effect would be that beneficial interests are held as tenants in common in proportion to contributions (allowing each to dispose of their beneficial share). But the facts state they 'registered the property as joint tenants' and 'each contributing 50%' - this suggests both legal and beneficial joint tenancy. Without evidence of severance or beneficial tenancy in common, the right of survivorship applies. The answer raises resulting trust but the facts do not support it.",
          "D": "While this answer correctly identifies that a deed is required to sever joint tenancy (per the notes), it is incomplete. The notes state: 'Joint tenancy must be severed by: (a) deed (for unregistered land) (CLPA s 66A) or (b) instrument of declaration in approved form (for registered land) (LTA s 53(5)) and (c) serving copy on other joint tenants.' For registered land, an instrument of declaration (not just a deed) is required. Furthermore, the answer structure suggests severance is necessary for the son to claim, which is correct. But by saying 'unless the testator executed a deed,' this implies the deed was not executed (which is likely true), making the answer essentially agree that the son cannot claim. The better answer is B, which directly states the legal position (will cannot sever joint tenancy) rather than stating the condition that would need to be met."

      "question": "Father transfers a property into joint names with his daughter, with the daughter contributing nothing to the purchase price. The father retains all rental income from the property and pays all expenses. When the father dies, his will attempts to give his 'share' in this property to his son. Can the son claim the property under the will?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes, because the father paid the full purchase price and had a resulting trust in his favor.",
        "B": "No, because the presumption of advancement applies between father and daughter, giving the daughter full beneficial ownership.",
        "C": "Yes, because the father's retention of rental income and payment of expenses rebuts the presumption of advancement.",
        "D": "No, because a will cannot sever a joint tenancy, so the daughter receives by survivorship."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The son can claim if the presumption of advancement is rebutted. The notes explain: 'Presumption of advancement can rebut presumption of resulting trust... where there is a pre-existing relationship between the parties which falls into one of the established categories of relationships' (Lau Siew Kim at [107]). Father-child is a traditional category attracting presumption of advancement. When a father transfers property to a child without contribution from the child, there is a presumption that the father intended to gift the beneficial interest (presumption of advancement). This would make the daughter the full beneficial owner, with no resulting trust in favor of the father. However, the presumption can be rebutted. The notes from Low Gim Siah at [51] and Chye Seng Kai at [23] provide examples of rebuttal: 'LKT had full and complete dominion over the money in the six joint accounts throughout his life - this fact is sufficient to rebut the presumption... LGB was not given the opportunity to operate the account. LKT kept all the accrued interest and retained the power to close and/or deal with Account 6 as he wished.' Here, the father 'retains all rental income from the property and pays all expenses' - this is evidence of full dominion and control, similar to the bank account cases. This conduct suggests the father did not intend to gift beneficial ownership to the daughter, rebutting the presumption of advancement. If the presumption is rebutted, a resulting trust arises (father retains beneficial interest despite legal title being joint). With beneficial tenancy in common (or sole beneficial ownership in father), the will can dispose of the father's beneficial interest to the son.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This answer correctly identifies that the father's full payment of purchase price would normally create a resulting trust, but ignores the presumption of advancement. The notes explain: 'Presumption of Resulting trust: \"where a transfer of property to another takes place for which the recipient does not provide the whole of the consideration\"' (Chan Yuen Lan at [47]). Here, the daughter contributed nothing, so normally a resulting trust would arise in favor of the father. However, the notes continue: 'Presumption of advancement can rebut presumption of resulting trust: \"where there is a pre-existing relationship between the parties which falls into one of the established categories of relationships\"' (Lau Siew Kim at [107]). Father-daughter is such a relationship. So the analysis is: (1) resulting trust arises from no contribution, BUT (2) presumption of advancement applies father-daughter, rebutting the resulting trust. The question then becomes whether the presumption of advancement is itself rebutted by the father's conduct (retaining income, paying expenses). Answer C captures this nuanced analysis, while answer A jumps straight to resulting trust without considering advancement.",
          "B": "This answer correctly identifies that presumption of advancement applies father-daughter, but fails to consider whether the presumption is rebutted. The notes from Low Gim Siah and Chye Seng Kai show that the presumption of advancement can be rebutted by evidence showing the father retained full dominion and control. The notes state: 'Application and Strength of presumption depends on a \"holistic examination of all the facts\"' (Lau Siew Kim at [107]). Here, the father's retention of rental income and payment of all expenses is strong evidence that the father did not intend to gift beneficial ownership. This is similar to the bank account cases where retention of income and control rebutted advancement. If the presumption is not rebutted, the daughter would get the entire property (beneficial ownership plus legal title). But if the presumption is rebutted, a resulting trust arises, the father retains beneficial interest, and the will can dispose of it to the son. The answer treats the presumption as conclusive when it is rebuttable.",
          "D": "While it is true that a will cannot sever a joint tenancy at law (s 35(1) CLPA), this analysis is incomplete because it does not consider the possibility of beneficial tenancy in common arising from resulting trust with rebutted advancement. The notes explain two strategies: '(a) Joint tenancy must be severed by [deed/instrument]... (b) Argue for equitable tenancy in common (i.e. that there was severance) due to resulting trust or constructive trust.' Even if legal title is held as joint tenants (triggering survivorship at law), beneficial interests might be held as tenants in common (if resulting trust arises). If the father has a beneficial tenant-in-common interest due to resulting trust (advancement rebutted), the will can dispose of this beneficial interest even though legal title passes by survivorship. The mechanics would be: (1) at death, legal title passes to daughter by survivorship, (2) but daughter holds 50% (or whatever proportion) on resulting trust for the son per the will. This is a more complex analysis than simple survivorship. Answer C captures this by referencing the rebuttal of advancement."

        "C": "Yes, the son receives 60% beneficial interest (80% minus 20% for the wife's contribution).",
        "D": "No, because joint tenancy means equal beneficial interests regardless of contribution."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The son cannot claim because the presumption of advancement applies between spouses. The notes state: 'Presumption of advancement can rebut presumption of resulting trust... Traditional categories: \"joint tenants are spouses\"' (Lau Siew Kim at [107]). When spouses purchase property as joint tenants, even with unequal contributions, the presumption of advancement applies. This presumes the contributing spouse intended to gift beneficial interest to the other spouse. Here, the testator contributed $800,000 (80%) and the wife contributed $200,000 (20%). Normally, this unequal contribution would create a resulting trust with the testator having 80% beneficial interest. But because they are spouses, the presumption of advancement applies, rebutting the resulting trust. The presumption gives the wife full beneficial ownership (both legal and equitable title as joint tenants). At the testator's death, the wife receives the entire property by survivorship with no resulting trust in favor of the testator or his estate. The notes from Lau Siew Kim confirm that for spouses who are joint tenants, advancement typically applies. The testator's will attempting to give his 'share' is ineffective because: (1) joint tenancy means no separate shares, and (2) the testator has no beneficial interest to give (all belongs to wife via advancement).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores the presumption of advancement that applies between spouses. While unequal contribution ($800,000 vs $200,000) would normally create a resulting trust giving the testator 80% beneficial interest, the notes explain: 'Presumption of advancement can rebut presumption of resulting trust: \"where there is a pre-existing relationship between the parties which falls into one of the established categories of relationships\"' (Lau Siew Kim at [107]). The notes specifically state: 'Traditional categories: \"joint tenants are spouses\"...' When spouses are joint tenants, the presumption of advancement applies, treating the property as beneficially owned in equal shares or as a gift from the contributing spouse to the non-contributing spouse. The answer fails to consider advancement and incorrectly applies resulting trust mechanically based on contribution.",
          "C": "This answer is confused about how beneficial interests work. It seems to suggest the son gets 80% (testator's contribution) minus 20% (wife's contribution) = 60%, which makes no mathematical or legal sense. If a resulting trust applied, the testator would have 80% beneficial interest (not 80% minus 20%). The wife's 20% contribution gives her a 20% beneficial interest, not a 20% reduction in the testator's interest. But more fundamentally, the presumption of advancement applies between spouses, preventing the resulting trust from arising in the first place. The answer demonstrates confused understanding of how contributions translate to beneficial interests and ignores the advancement presumption.",
          "D": "This answer suggests joint tenancy automatically means equal beneficial interests, which is incorrect. The notes explain that unequal contributions can create resulting trusts even when legal title is held as joint tenants: 'Framework of analysis same as for property set out in Lau Siew Kim (Estate of Yang Chun)' applies to both property and bank accounts. The question is not whether joint tenancy automatically creates equal beneficial interests, but whether the resulting trust (arising from unequal contribution) is rebutted by the presumption of advancement (arising from the spousal relationship). Here, advancement applies and rebuts the resulting trust, but the answer gives the wrong reason. The answer incorrectly suggests joint tenancy legally mandates equal beneficial interests when the reality is that beneficial interests can differ from legal title based on resulting trust, advancement, and constructive trust doctrines."

      "question": "Testator nominated his wife as beneficiary of his CPF monies ($300,000) through a proper CPF nomination. The testator's will gives his entire estate to his children from a previous marriage. After the testator's death, the children argue the CPF should form part of the estate and be distributed under the will. Applying Saniah Ali, which of the following is correct?",

        "D": "The wife holds the CPF on trust for the children as Faraid beneficiaries."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The wife receives the CPF as nominee because nominated CPF does not form part of the estate. In Saniah Ali v Abdullah Ali [1990], the court held that 'CPF money does not form part of estate (Saniah).' The notes explain: 'CPF moneys with nomination do NOT form part of the deceased's estate... the court stated: \"moneys in the CPF... are specifically excluded from the estate of the deceased, and that being so, the moneys do not form part of the estate of the deceased member and are therefore not subject to s 112(1) of the AMLA; in other words, that section does not apply to those moneys.\"' This is based on express exclusion in the CPF Act itself. The notes further state: 'Member must nominate beneficiaries using CPF nomination form; otherwise, it will go to Public Trustee for disposal under Intestate Succession Act (CPF Act s 25A).' Here, the testator made a valid CPF nomination in favor of his wife. Therefore, the $300,000 passes directly to the wife outside the estate. The will disposes of 'the estate' to the children - but CPF is not part of the estate, so the children get the estate assets (excluding CPF). The wife gets the CPF. The nomination operates like a will substitute, allowing the testator to direct CPF separately from the estate.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is directly contradicted by Saniah Ali. The case held that CPF moneys with nomination 'do not form part of the estate of the deceased.' The notes emphasize: 'CPF moneys with nomination do NOT form part of the deceased's estate and are not subject to s 112(1) of the AMLA.' If CPF with nomination formed part of the estate, the nomination would be meaningless - the estate would be distributed according to the will (or intestacy if no will), ignoring the nomination. This would undermine the entire CPF nomination system. The CPF Act specifically excludes nominated CPF from the estate, allowing members to direct distribution of CPF separately. This is a statutory exception to the general rule that a deceased's assets form part of the estate. Here, the CPF was nominated to the wife, so it goes to her directly, not to the estate. The children receive the estate (other assets) under the will, but not the CPF.",
          "C": "This answer invents a 50-50 split that has no basis in law. The notes explain that CPF with nomination goes entirely to the nominee, not partially to the nominee and partially to the estate. The CPF Act provides that nominated CPF 'shall not form part of the estate of the deceased member' and is paid to nominees - this is all or nothing. Either CPF is nominated (goes to nominee), or it is not nominated (goes to estate for distribution). There is no mechanism for splitting nominated CPF between the nominee and estate beneficiaries. If the testator wanted both the wife and children to receive CPF, the testator could: (1) nominate both wife and children in specific percentages through the CPF nomination (e.g., 50% to wife, 50% to children), or (2) not nominate anyone, letting CPF go to the estate where the will or intestacy distributes it. But here, the testator nominated only the wife, so she gets 100% of CPF. The answer incorrectly creates a split distribution.",
          "D": "This answer references an outdated Fatwa position from before 2010. The notes explain: 'there was a fatwa at the time that said that the nominee would only hold the CPF monies as a trustee on behalf of the Faraid beneficiary.' However, the court in Saniah Ali rejected this, holding that a 'Fatwa is merely an opinion of the Fatwa Committee of the Majlis (MUIS) and not binding on the Court.' The legal position based on the CPF Act is that nominees receive CPF beneficially, not as trustees. The notes continue: 'Fatwa on CPF Monies was subsequently revised. Fatwa on CPF was updated on 3 August 2010 to permit nomination as a new form of hibah (gift)... CPF nomination equals to hibah (gift).' Under current law (both civil law via Saniah Ali and Muslim law via the 2010 Fatwa), the wife receives CPF as a gift (hibah), not as trustee. The children have no claim to it.

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The flat can pass only with HDB's consent. The notes state: 'HDB flat cannot pass by bequest without HDB's consent (HDA s 59(1)).' Section 59(1) Housing and Development Act restricts the transfer of HDB flats, including transfers by will. Even though the will gives the flat to the son, HDB's approval is required before the son can take ownership. This reflects HDB's policy of controlling flat ownership to ensure eligibility requirements are met. HDB will consider: (1) whether the son is eligible to own an HDB flat under s 50(1) HDA (the notes state: 'No person can buy an HDB flat if he, his spouse or any authorised occupier owns another HDB flat, or has sold another HDB flat in the last 30 months (s 50(1))'), (2) whether the flat was originally purchased with subsidies or grants that have conditions, (3) whether the son meets citizenship/residency requirements, and (4) other HDB eligibility criteria. If HDB consents, the flat transfers to the son under the will. If HDB refuses consent, the flat cannot pass to the son - the executor may need to sell the flat and give the proceeds to the son, or apply to HDB for alternative arrangements.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because HDB flats are subject to statutory restrictions on transfer, including transfers by bequest. The notes state: 'HDB flat cannot pass by bequest without HDB's consent (HDA s 59(1)).' The will expresses the testator's intention, but this intention can only be effected with HDB approval. Unlike private property which passes automatically under a will, HDB flats are public housing subject to regulatory control. The testator can include the flat in the will (as here), but the executor must seek HDB consent before transferring to the son. This is not automatic. HDB may refuse consent if the son is ineligible (e.g., already owns an HDB flat). The answer incorrectly suggests automatic transfer without HDB involvement.",
          "B": "This overstates the restriction. The notes say HDB flats 'cannot pass by bequest without HDB's consent' - the word 'without' is critical. HDB flats CAN be bequeathed, but consent is required. This is different from saying they cannot be bequeathed 'under any circumstances.' If HDB consent is obtained, the flat can pass under the will. Many HDB flat owners include their flats in wills, and executors routinely apply to HDB for consent to transfer to beneficiaries. HDB often grants consent if the beneficiary is eligible. The restriction is procedural (consent required) not absolute (never allowed). If the answer were correct, there would be no point in HDB having a consent process - they could simply state flats cannot be bequeathed, period. The existence of s 59(1) (requiring consent) shows bequests are possible with approval.",
          "D": "While the son's eligibility is relevant to whether HDB will grant consent, it is not the only requirement, and the answer incorrectly suggests eligibility alone is sufficient. The notes mention eligibility criteria: 'No person can buy an HDB flat if he, his spouse or any authorised occupier owns another HDB flat, or has sold another HDB flat in the last 30 months (s 50(1)).' If the son is eligible (doesn't own another flat, hasn't sold recently, etc.), this increases the likelihood HDB will consent. But HDB consent is still required - eligibility does not make the transfer automatic. HDB must affirmatively approve. Furthermore, there may be other requirements beyond s 50(1) eligibility (citizenship, income limits if there were grants/subsidies on the flat, etc.). The answer is partially correct in identifying eligibility as important, but incorrect in suggesting it is the sole determinant. Answer C is better because it identifies the core legal requirement: HDB consent."

Section 73 CLPA creates a statutory trust for insurance policies in favor of the insured's spouse and children. Critically, the notes state such proceeds 'cannot be disposed by will.' This is because the trust arose upon the policy being effected, vesting beneficial interest in the spouse and children. The policy proceeds belong to them beneficially, not to the testator's estate. The testator can name them in the will, but this is legally ineffective - the will cannot override the statutory trust. Here, the 2005 policy predates 1 September 2009, so s 73 CLPA applies. The trust was created in favor of the wife and children when the policy was effected in 2005. The testator's later will (attempting to give proceeds to the nephew) cannot defeat this trust. The wife and children receive the proceeds under s 73, and the nephew receives nothing from this policy.",

If the testator could dispose of such policy proceeds by will, the s 73 trust would be meaningless. The policy behind s 73 is to protect family members (spouse and children) by ensuring life insurance proceeds benefit them, regardless of the testator's later intentions. This is a mandatory trust that arises by statute. The testator cannot defeat it by will. The answer incorrectly suggests the will overrides the statutory trust.",

This is a vested beneficial interest that the spouse and children have from the time the policy was effected. They do not need to 'agree' to receive it or 'refuse' to allow the nephew to receive it - it belongs to them by operation of s 73. Requiring their consent would effectively give them the power to redirect the proceeds, which is inconsistent with the mandatory nature of the s 73 trust. If they could consent to the nephew receiving the proceeds, this would be a form of disposition of their beneficial interest, which might have tax and other implications. The law does not require or contemplate such consent - the trust beneficiaries (wife and children) simply receive the proceeds by operation of statute.",

The notes state the proceeds 'does not form part of the estate' and 'cannot be disposed by will' - this is categorical. The entire proceeds go to the trust beneficiaries (wife and children), not partially to them and partially to the will beneficiary (nephew). Section 73 creates a complete trust of the policy moneys in favor of spouse and children. There is no room for the will to take a portion. If the law allowed the will to take some portion, this would partially defeat the protective purpose of s 73. The statute is clear: the proceeds are excluded from the estate and held on trust for spouse and children. The answer incorrectly suggests a partial distribution that has no statutory basis."

Nomination made is deemed REVOKED if after making the nomination, the policy owner makes a will in accordance with the Wills Act 1838 which provides for the disposition of all death benefits AND specifies such particulars of the relevant policy as prescribed (s 133(7)(b) IA).' Section 133(7)(b) Insurance Act provides that a revocable nomination is automatically revoked when the insured makes a will that: (1) is made in accordance with the Wills Act, (2) provides for disposition of all death benefits from the policy, and (3) specifies prescribed particulars of the policy. Here, all three requirements are met: (1) the will was executed 'under the Wills Act,' (2) it gives 'all death benefits from my insurance policies' to the daughter (disposing of all death benefits), and (3) it 'specifies the policy number and other particulars.' Therefore, the revocable nomination to the friend is deemed revoked by operation of s 133(7)(b), and the will controls distribution. The daughter receives the policy proceeds.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because for revocable nominations (post-1 September 2009 policies), wills CAN revoke the nomination and take priority.

For revocable nominations, s 133(7)(b) IA specifically provides that a will satisfying certain conditions deems the nomination revoked. This allows testators to change their minds about insurance proceeds through their wills without having to separately revoke the nomination. Here, the testator made a revocable nomination (not a trust nomination), so the will can override it. The answer incorrectly treats all nominations as taking absolute priority over wills, when only trust nominations have such priority.",

It is not simply that 'the will was executed after the nomination' that gives the daughter priority.

If the will did not meet these conditions (e.g., did not specify policy particulars, or did not dispose of 'all death benefits'), the nomination would stand even if the will came later. The statute requires specific things in the will, not just later execution. Furthermore, if the answer's reasoning were correct (later document prevails), then the testator could revoke the will by making a new nomination after the will, which is not how it works. The answer uses temporal priority reasoning when the actual basis is s 133(7)(b)'s specific requirements.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no mechanism for splitting proceeds between a nominee and a will beneficiary for a single policy. Section 133(7)(b) IA provides that the nomination is 'deemed REVOKED' if the will meets the statutory conditions - revocation is complete, not partial. Once revoked, the nomination has no effect, and the proceeds pass under the will (if it disposes of them) or to the estate (for distribution by will or intestacy). Here, the nomination is revoked, so the friend has no claim. The entire proceeds go to the daughter under the will. If proceeds could be split between nominees and will beneficiaries, this would create enormous complexity: how would the split be determined? The answer invents a splitting mechanism that does not exist. The law is binary: either the nomination stands (friend gets all), or it is revoked (daughter gets all per will)."

Here, the testator and girlfriend agreed that 'if they separated, the property would be sold and proceeds divided 70-30.' This is an agreement about future proceeds of sale (what happens if they separate and sell), not an agreement that they presently hold beneficial interests as tenants in common in 70-30 proportions.

This suggests courts are cautious about extending advancement to cohabitants, but have not definitively ruled it out. However, the question is framed around 'Applying Chan Yuen Lan and V Nithia,' which focus on constructive trust (answer B/C). More importantly, even if a resulting trust arises in favor of the testator giving him 70% beneficial interest, the will still cannot dispose of it because legal title is held as joint tenants. The notes state: 'a will CANNOT sever joint tenancy (s 35(1) CLPA).' Even with beneficial tenant in common interests, legal joint tenancy means survivorship operates, and the girlfriend gets legal title. The answer fails to address the joint tenancy problem.",

Here, the agreement was 'if they separated, the property would be sold and proceeds divided 70-30' - this is about future events (separation, sale) and future distribution of proceeds. It is not an agreement that they currently hold as beneficial tenants in common in 70-30 proportions. Furthermore, even if there were such common intention, has there been detrimental reliance? The notes require 'common intention... and there is detrimental reliance.' It is unclear what detrimental reliance occurred here.

Extending to cohabitants would be a significant expansion that the court in Ng So Hang declined to make. Therefore, the presumption of advancement is unlikely to apply here. If it does not apply, and there is unequal contribution, a resulting trust would normally arise. But the question is about the agreement and constructive trust (per V Nithia), not about advancement.

For father-son relationships, presumption of advancement normally applies.

Here, even though advancement normally applies father-son, the testator's full control and dominion rebuts it. The notes from Low Gim Siah and Chye Seng Kai show that retention of control defeats advancement. If advancement is rebutted, a resulting trust arises - the son holds legal title jointly but beneficially the money belongs to the testator's estate. Legal survivorship occurs, but the son receives as resulting trustee for the estate, not beneficially. The answer incorrectly assumes automatic beneficial survivorship.",

The facts here strongly suggest rebuttal: the testator contributed 100%, retained full control, the son never operated the account, and the testator could close it unilaterally. These are the same factors that rebutted advancement in Low Gim Siah and Chye Seng Kai. The notes from Low Gim Siah at [51] state: 'LKT had full and complete dominion over the money in the six joint accounts throughout his life - this fact is sufficient to rebut the presumption...' The presumption of advancement is rebuttable, not conclusive. When rebutted, a resulting trust arises in favor of the contributor (testator).

While it is true the son made no contribution, this alone does not defeat his claim under advancement.

If advancement applied unrebutted, the son would have beneficial interest despite no contribution - that is the whole point of the advancement presumption (parent intending to gift to child). What defeats the son's claim is not lack of contribution per se, but the rebuttal of advancement through the testator's retention of full control. The notes from Chye Seng Kai explain that 'Chye Moi June herself accepted in cross-examination that the CMJ Joint Accounts belonged to the father in his lifetime' - showing that beneficial ownership during lifetime (evidenced by control) rebuts advancement.

The court held at [16]: 'Precatory words or expression of desire is unenforceable, e.g. \"wish and strong desire.\"' The notes explain: 'It was extremely unlikely that the testator had intended by the word \"entrust\" to create an actual trust when the shares in the Company had already been gifted to the beneficiaries absolutely under cl 3 and the \"business\" was actually owned by the subsidiaries of the Company. Such a trust would contradict cl 3. As cl 3 was unambiguous, cl 4 ought to be construed in a manner that was harmonious with cl 3.' Here, the exact same structure exists: shares gifted absolutely in an earlier clause, followed by precatory language about wishes. The word 'entrust' might suggest a trust, but when shares are already given absolutely, a later trust would contradict the absolute gift.

Such a trust would contradict [the earlier gift]. As [the earlier clause] was unambiguous, [the later clause] ought to be construed in a manner that was harmonious with [it].' If a trust were created, the beneficiaries would hold shares beneficially but the son would somehow become trustee of 'the business' (already owned by the beneficiaries through the shares). This is incoherent. The beneficiaries already own the shares absolutely - they cannot simultaneously own beneficially and have someone else hold on trust.

There was no reason why the rule against restraints on alienation, which typically applied to real property, should not also apply to personalty. Furthermore, cl 4 was too conceptually uncertain to be valid.' So there are two problems: (1) conditions restraining alienation or requiring beneficiaries to 'work together' are void as restraints on alienation, and (2) the clause is too uncertain (what does 'work together' mean? how is breach determined?). The answer incorrectly suggests the clause is a valid condition subsequent when Lau Tyng Tyng held it would be invalid even if so construed.",

If beneficiaries receive property absolutely, they must be free to deal with it (sell, gift, mortgage, etc.). A clause prohibiting alienation is a restraint that is void as against public policy. If such restraints were valid, property could be tied up indefinitely, preventing free market transactions. The law strikes down such restraints to promote marketability of property. Here, even if the clause were construed as a restraint (which it is not - it is merely precatory), it would be void. The answer incorrectly suggests a valid restraint exists."

The ring was handed over and the girlfriend took possession. After death, the deceased's children argue the ring should form part of the estate. Applying the principles in WDS v WDT and Koh Cheong Heng, is this a valid donatio mortis causa?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes, all three elements are satisfied: gift in contemplation of death, conditional on death, and delivery of the subject matter.",
        "B": "No, because gifts made in contemplation of death must comply with Wills Act formalities.",
        "C": "Yes, but only if the girlfriend can prove the deceased had testamentary capacity.",
        "D": "No, because the gift was intended to take effect immediately, not upon death."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "This is likely a valid donatio mortis causa with all three elements satisfied. The notes from Koh Cheong Heng define the elements: '(1) makes a gift to another (the Donee) in contemplation of death, (2) to take effect in the future and which remains conditional until the Donor dies, and (3) there must be delivery of the subject matter of the gift or something representing it, where the donor intends to impart dominion over it.' Element (1): the deceased was dying from terminal cancer and made the gift 'one week before dying,' saying 'This is for you when I'm gone.' This is clearly in contemplation of impending death. Element (2): the words 'when I'm gone' suggest the gift is to take effect upon death (conditional on death). Though the ring was given immediately, the statement suggests full ownership transfers at death. Element (3): the ring was 'handed over and the girlfriend took possession' - there was delivery of the subject matter and the girlfriend accepted it, with the deceased intending to part with dominion. The notes state: 'NOT EXCLUDED by WA s 6 as not nuncupative will (Koh Cheong Heng, [21])' - donatio mortis causa is not subject to Wills Act formalities. This is an equitable doctrine allowing deathbed gifts without formal requirements. The notes from WDS v WDT provide a counter-example where donatio mortis causa failed (deed not completed, no delivery), but here delivery occurred.",
        "incorrect": {
          "B": "This is incorrect because donatio mortis causa is specifically excepted from Wills Act formalities. The notes state: 'NOT EXCLUDED by WA s 6 as not nuncupative will (Koh Cheong Heng, [21]).' Section 6 Wills Act requires wills to be in writing, signed, and witnessed. Nuncupative wills (oral wills) are invalid under s 6(1) except for soldiers/mariners. But donatio mortis causa is not a type of will - it is an inter vivos gift (made during life) that takes full effect upon death. Because it is not a will, Wills Act formalities do not apply. The notes confirm that donatio mortis causa can be valid without writing or witnesses, as long as the three elements are satisfied. If Wills Act formalities were required, the doctrine would be meaningless - it exists precisely to allow informal deathbed gifts. The answer incorrectly applies Wills Act formalities to donatio mortis causa.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because testamentary capacity is not a requirement for donatio mortis causa. Donatio mortis causa is a gift, not a testamentary disposition. The capacity required is capacity to make a gift (donor understands they are giving property away and to whom), not testamentary capacity (the four-part test from Banks v Goodfellow). The requirements for donatio mortis causa are the three elements: contemplation of death, conditional on death, and delivery. Capacity to make gifts is assumed unless the girlfriend is alleging the deceased lacked capacity due to mental incapacity or undue influence, which is not indicated here. The deceased had terminal cancer (physical illness) but this does not affect mental capacity to make gifts. If testamentary capacity were required for donatio mortis causa, this would significantly undermine the doctrine, as many deathbed donors are very ill (though mentally alert). The answer incorrectly imports testamentary capacity requirements.",
          "D": "This is a closer question but probably incorrect on these facts. The second element of donatio mortis causa requires the gift 'to take effect in the future and which remains conditional until the Donor dies' (Koh Cheong Heng). The deceased said 'This is for you when I'm gone' - the phrase 'when I'm gone' suggests the gift is meant for after death. However, the notes from Koh Cheong Heng state: 'Gift made on condition that it is absolute on complete only on death. Can be implied from fact that donor was ill' (at [13b]). Even if the physical delivery was immediate, the condition that the gift becomes absolute only on death can be implied from the terminal illness and the words 'when I'm gone.' The girlfriend received possession but might hold conditionally until death (with reversion to donor if donor recovered, though recovery was impossible here with terminal cancer). The answer argues the gift was immediate, but the words 'when I'm gone' and the terminal cancer context suggest the conditional element is satisfied."

      "question": "Testator's will gives 'my estate to my trustees to hold for my son until he reaches age 30, at which time the capital shall be given to him absolutely.' The son is 25 when the testator dies. Can the executor distribute the estate directly to the son, or must a trust be established?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The executor can distribute directly to the son as the son is an adult over 21.",
        "B": "A trust must be established until the son reaches 30 as specified in the will.",
        "C": "The executor can distribute to the son if the son provides security for proper use of the funds.",
        "D": "The age 30 condition is void as an unreasonable restraint, so the son receives immediately."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "A trust must be established per the will's terms. The notes explain 'Testamentary trust' as one type of disposition in wills. When a testator directs that property be held on trust with specific conditions (here, holding until son reaches 30), the executor must establish and operate the trust according to those terms. The will clearly states the estate is to be held 'for my son until he reaches age 30, at which time the capital shall be given to him absolutely.' This creates a testamentary trust with: (1) trustees (initially the executors, who become trustees upon establishing the trust), (2) beneficiary (the son), and (3) terms (hold until age 30, then distribute capital). The son has a vested interest subject to timing (he will receive at 30), but does not have a current right to demand the capital. The trustees must manage the estate for 5 years (age 25 to 30), likely paying income to the son or accumulating it, then distributing capital when he turns 30. The executor cannot simply hand over the estate now just because the son is over 21. The will's terms control, and those terms require a trust until age 30.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because reaching age 21 (majority) does not override express trust terms requiring property to be held until age 30. While age 21 is the age of majority for most purposes (capacity to contract, vote, etc.) and is relevant to when executors can distribute without trust (s 6(2) PAA requires two administrators if there is a minor beneficiary), this does not mean all property must be distributed at 21. Testators have freedom to impose age conditions beyond 21. Here, the testator wanted the son to receive the capital at 30, presumably believing the son would be more mature or financially responsible at 30 than at 25. The will expressly creates a trust 'until he reaches age 30' - this is a clear direction that must be followed. Executors/trustees cannot override the testator's express terms simply because the beneficiary is an adult. The answer incorrectly prioritizes the age of majority over the will's express terms.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because there is no provision in the law allowing executors to distribute trust property early upon the beneficiary providing security. The will creates a trust with a specific termination date (son's 30th birthday). The trustees have no discretion to distribute earlier, even with security. The son has a future vested interest (he will receive at 30), not a current right to demand distribution. If trustees could distribute early with security, this would undermine the testator's intentions. The testator specifically chose age 30, not 21 or 25. Perhaps the testator feared the son would squander the money if received too young. Security does not address this concern - it protects against loss, not against improvident spending. The trustees must hold until age 30 as the will directs. The answer invents a security mechanism that does not exist for testamentary trusts.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because an age condition (vesting at 30) is not a restraint on alienation and is not void. The notes from Lau Tyng Tyng discuss restraints on alienation: conditions that prevent beneficiaries from selling or transferring property they have received. Here, the condition is not 'you cannot sell until 30' but rather 'you do not receive until 30.' The son does not yet have the property, so there is no restraint on his ability to alienate it. Once the son receives the capital at 30, he can sell it immediately if he wishes - there is no restraint. The will simply defers the timing of receipt, which is a valid testamentary disposition. Testators routinely impose age conditions (receive at 21, 25, 30, etc.) to protect young beneficiaries. Such conditions are valid and common. If they were void as unreasonable restraints, most testamentary trusts for young beneficiaries would fail. The answer incorrectly characterizes an age condition as a restraint on alienation."

Testator's will gives his estate to his spouse, and if the spouse predeceases, to his children. Under section 30 Civil Law Act, how is the estate distributed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The estate is divided equally between the testator's and spouse's estates as they died simultaneously.",
        "B": "The testator is presumed to have died first, so the spouse is deemed to have survived and the spouse's estate receives the testator's estate.",

        "D": "The presumption cannot apply to simultaneous deaths, so intestacy rules apply."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The testator is deemed to have died first. Section 30 Civil Law Act provides: 'Presumption of survivorship in regard to claim to property: when uncertain, younger presumed to die after the older (s 30 CLA) - when 2 people die at the same time, older person is deemed to have died first.' Here, the testator was 60 (older) and spouse was 55 (younger). Under s 30, the older person (testator, age 60) is presumed to have died first. The younger person (spouse, age 55) is presumed to have died after - that is, the spouse survived the testator, even if only by a legal fiction of moments. Because the spouse is deemed to have survived the testator, the primary gift in the will ('I give my estate to my spouse') takes effect. The spouse's estate receives the testator's estate. The gift-over provision ('if the spouse predeceases') does NOT take effect because the spouse did not predecease - the spouse survived (per the s 30 presumption). After the spouse's (deemed later) death, the spouse's estate (now including the testator's estate) is distributed according to the spouse's will or intestacy. The children might receive through the spouse's estate if they are beneficiaries there, but not directly under the testator's will's gift-over clause.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 30 CLA does not provide for equal division in simultaneous deaths. Instead, it creates a presumption that resolves the order of death based on age: the older person is deemed to have died first, the younger person is deemed to have died second (survived longer). This allows property to flow in one direction based on the wills' terms, rather than being split equally. Equal division would create complexity: each estate would receive half from the other, requiring cross-administration and potentially circular distributions. The s 30 presumption avoids this by establishing a definite order of death. The answer incorrectly suggests equal division when s 30 provides an age-based survivorship presumption.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it reverses the s 30 presumption. The notes state: 'when uncertain, younger presumed to die after the older... when 2 people die at the same time, older person is deemed to have died first.' The testator (60) is older, so the testator is deemed to have died FIRST. The spouse (55) is younger, so the spouse is deemed to have died AFTER (survived the testator). If the spouse survived the testator (even by presumption), the spouse did NOT predecease. Therefore, the gift-over condition ('if the spouse predeceases') is not satisfied. The primary gift ('to my spouse') takes effect because the spouse survived. The gift-over does not take effect. The answer reverses who is presumed to have died first.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 30 CLA specifically applies to simultaneous deaths. The notes state: 'when 2 people die at the same time, older person is deemed to have died first' - this is precisely the scenario s 30 is designed to address. When it is uncertain who died first (such as in a car accident where both die simultaneously), s 30 provides a presumption based on age to resolve the uncertainty. The presumption allows wills and intestacy rules to operate based on a determined order of death. Without s 30, simultaneous deaths would create impossibility of determining who inherits from whom. The answer incorrectly suggests s 30 cannot apply when simultaneous death is exactly when it applies."

When the testator married the second woman, this marriage automatically revoked the prior CPF nomination to the first wife under s 25(5)(a). The policy is similar to s 13 Wills Act (marriage revokes wills): marriage is such a significant change that the law presumes the member would want to reconsider CPF beneficiaries to provide for the new spouse. After the marriage to the second woman, the nomination to the first wife is revoked. The testator dies without making a new nomination. The notes state: 'Member must nominate beneficiaries using CPF nomination form; otherwise, it will go to Public Trustee for disposal under Intestate Succession Act (CPF Act s 25A).' So the CPF would normally go to Public Trustee for distribution under ISA. Under ISA, the current spouse (second wife) would be entitled to a share (50% if there are children, 100% if no children or parents).

The testator would need to make a new nomination after marriage if he wanted to benefit anyone (including the second wife) from CPF.

The answer incorrectly suggests nominations remain valid through subsequent marriages.",

Once the nomination to the first wife was revoked by the marriage to the second wife, the first wife has no claim to the CPF. The CPF goes to Public Trustee for distribution under ISA (after the nomination was revoked and no new nomination made). Under ISA, only the current spouse at death (second wife) would be considered a spouse-beneficiary, not former wives. The first wife, no longer married to the testator, is not a spouse under ISA. The answer incorrectly suggests both wives share when only the current wife has a claim through intestacy.",
          "D": "The nomination is not invalid - it was valid when made, but was later revoked by the marriage. This is different from being invalid. An invalid nomination would be one that never had legal effect (e.g., not properly made on the CPF form). A revoked nomination was once valid but has been cancelled. Here, the nomination to the first wife was valid initially, then revoked by the marriage to the second wife. After revocation, the CPF goes to Public Trustee for distribution under ISA, not because the nomination is 'invalid' but because it was revoked and no new nomination was made.

This shows that: (1) no presumption of advancement applies to unmarried cohabiting couples (consistent with Ng So Hang's doubt about extending advancement to such relationships), BUT (2) actual intention to gift can still be proven from the facts. Without the presumption, the default would be a resulting trust (testator contributed $200,000, so would have 100% beneficial interest). However, if Bee Bee can prove from the circumstances (how the account was used, statements made, conduct) that the testator actually intended to gift the money to her, she can receive it.

The traditional categories for advancement are legally married spouses and parent-child relationships. Living together 'as husband and wife' without legal marriage is not sufficient to trigger the presumption.

Without advancement, the starting point is a resulting trust (testator gets beneficial interest because he contributed). But if Bee Bee can prove from the evidence that the testator actually intended to gift the money to her (through his statements, conduct, how the account was operated, etc.), she can receive it. The absence of the presumption means Bee Bee bears the burden of proving actual intention, but it does not make her claim impossible.

Here, the testator contributed $200,000 (100%) and Bee Bee contributed nothing. Without a presumption or proof of actual intention to gift, a resulting trust would give the testator 100% beneficial interest (estate gets all). If Bee Bee proves actual intention to gift, she gets 100%. There is no middle ground of equal division based on relationship length. The answer invents an equal division rule that does not exist."

Section 3(3) and (4) Residential Property Act restricts foreign ownership of landed property. When a testator bequeaths landed property to a foreign person, the property cannot pass directly to that person. Instead, the executor becomes subject to a statutory duty to sell the property within 5 years of the testator's death and pay the sale proceeds to the foreign beneficiary. This allows the testator's intention (to benefit the nephew) to be partially honored (nephew gets the value) while complying with RPA restrictions (foreign person does not own Singapore landed property).

The RPA restricts foreign ownership of landed residential property to preserve such property for Singapore citizens and PRs. Bequests cannot override this statutory restriction.

So foreign persons CAN own landed property if the Minister approves (though approval is rare and discretionary). Furthermore, s 3(4) provides a mechanism for bequests to foreign persons: the executor sells and pays proceeds.

The nephew could potentially apply to the Minister for approval to retain the property (asking for an exception to the general prohibition), but this is not guaranteed, and the default mechanism is sale under s 3(4). If the answer were correct (Minister's approval is the standard path), then s 3(4)'s sale requirement would be unnecessary - all foreign beneficiaries could simply apply for approval. The reality is that s 3(4) sale is the normal procedure, and Minister's approval is a possible but uncertain alternative. Answer C correctly identifies the statutory default (sale within 5 years)."

The court in Soon Ah See held that the word 'marriage' in s 25(5)(a) should be interpreted to mean genuine marital relationships, not sham marriages or marriages of convenience.

These are red flags suggesting the marriage might not be a genuine marital relationship. If the court finds the marriage was a sham (e.g., entered to obtain immigration benefits, to revoke CPF nominations, or for other illegitimate purposes rather than genuine intent to create a marital relationship), the marriage does not constitute a 'marriage' for purposes of s 25(5)(a). The prior nomination would remain valid. Whether the marriage is genuine is a factual determination based on all circumstances.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores the Soon Ah See holding that 'marriage' in s 25(5)(a) means genuine marital relationships only. While s 25(5)(a) states that marriage revokes nominations, the court held that this should be read down to exclude sham marriages or marriages of convenience. If all marriages, including shams, revoked nominations, people could manipulate the CPF system by entering sham marriages to revoke nominations fraudulently. For example, a member's relative could arrange a sham marriage for the member to revoke a nomination to someone the relative disliked, then divorce and make a new nomination. This would be an abuse of s 25(5)(a). The court prevents such abuse by reading 'marriage' to mean only genuine marriages. The answer incorrectly applies s 25(5)(a) without the Soon Ah See qualification.",
          "C": "This inverts the burden of proof. The issue is not whether the testator can prove the marriage was not genuine, but whether those challenging the marriage (e.g., the original CPF nominee or the testator's estate) can prove it was a sham. The testator is dead, so cannot prove anything. The legal issue is whether the marriage should be given effect for purposes of revoking the nomination. If someone argues the marriage was a sham, they bear the burden of proving it (showing the suspicious circumstances, lack of genuine intent, etc.). If no one challenges the marriage, it is presumed valid. Here, the suspicious facts provide grounds for challenging the marriage as a sham, but this requires a factual inquiry. The answer incorrectly requires the testator to prove genuineness when the testator is deceased.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no one-year or other durational requirement for marriages to revoke CPF nominations. Section 25(5)(a) states marriage revokes nominations without any time qualification. If the marriage is genuine, it revokes even if it lasts one day (e.g., member marries and dies the next day - the nomination is still revoked). If the marriage is a sham, it does not revoke even if it lasts many years (though a long-lasting marriage is evidence of genuineness). The issue is genuineness of the marital relationship, not duration. The answer invents a one-year requirement that does not exist in s 25(5)(a) or Soon Ah See."

        "correct": "The gift likely adeemed when the enforceable sale contract was entered. The notes explain the third scenario for ademption: '(3) The nature of the gift has changed its character, e.g. if shares sold under enforceable but uncompleted agreement before testator died, when equity would deem the shares to be in the form of money. However, the court did not think this rule should be received in Singapore (Low Gim Har, [58c]).' This indicates that in other jurisdictions, an enforceable but uncompleted contract might convert property into money in equity, but Singapore courts rejected this rule in Low Gim Har. Without the equitable conversion rule, we apply standard ademption: the testator entered a binding contract to sell the house. This is a form of disposing of the property. Even though the sale has not completed (transfer not yet occurred), the testator has committed to selling and cannot back out without breaching the contract. The property is effectively disposed of. Under scenario (1) in the notes: 'The subject-matter of the gift is disposed of or destroyed, e.g. shares sold (Low Gim Har, [58a])' - entering a sale contract is disposing of the property. Therefore, the gift adeems. The daughter receives nothing (neither the house nor the sale proceeds).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because entering an enforceable contract to sell is a form of disposing of the property that triggers ademption. While legal title has not yet transferred (completion has not occurred), the testator has bound himself to sell by entering an enforceable contract. The testator cannot withdraw from the sale without liability. Equity might consider the property as good as sold. The notes discuss whether equity deems property to be money once a sale contract exists (Low Gim Har [58c]), but even if equity does not apply that rule in Singapore, the basic principle remains: the testator has disposed of the property by contracting to sell. This is different from a mere intention to sell or negotiations - an enforceable contract creates binding obligations. Therefore, ademption applies. The daughter does not receive the house. The answer incorrectly suggests the gift is unaffected until completion.",

The notes state: 'if shares sold under enforceable but uncompleted agreement before testator died, when equity would deem the shares to be in the form of money. However, the court did not think this rule should be received in Singapore (Low Gim Har, [58c]).' Some jurisdictions apply equitable conversion: once there is an enforceable contract to sell, equity treats the property as money (purchase price) even before completion. If Singapore adopted this rule, the daughter might receive the sale proceeds (the money that will be paid upon completion). But Low Gim Har rejected this rule for Singapore. Without equitable conversion, the property has been disposed of (sale contract entered), triggering ademption, and the beneficiary receives nothing. The answer incorrectly applies an equitable conversion rule that Singapore rejected.",
          "D": "This answer is creative but likely incorrect. It suggests the daughter receives the house but the purchaser can complete the purchase, which would leave the daughter with nothing ultimately (since the purchaser would take the house upon completion). This seems internally contradictory. More fundamentally, once the testator entered an enforceable sale contract, the testator's ownership is limited - the testator must convey to the purchaser. The will cannot give the daughter property that the testator is bound to sell to someone else. The executor must complete the sale (honoring the testator's contractual obligations), and the proceeds belong to the estate. Because the gift of 'my property' has adeemed (property sold), the daughter does not receive the house or the proceeds. The answer suggests an impossible middle ground."

Here, the will gives to 'my children who are living at my death' - this is a class description ('my children') with a survivorship qualifier ('living at my death'). The notes from Loke Soh Lui indicate that describing children as a class (rather than naming each individually) creates a class gift. For class gifts where a class member predeceases, the normal rule (from the notes) is: 'In a class gift, the gift vis-à-vis the deceased child automatically lapses and the gift will be redistributed to the rest of the surviving children in equal shares.' So the three surviving children share the estate equally, and the deceased child's share redistributes to them. The deceased child's grandchildren do not receive anything (unlike under s 26, where they would take the deceased child's share). Section 26 applies to named beneficiaries, not class gifts.",

If the testator wanted grandchildren to receive in place of a predeceased child, the testator should either: (1) name each child individually (triggering s 26), or (2) include grandchildren in the class (e.g., 'my children and grandchildren living at my death'). Without these, the grandchildren receive nothing from a class gift to children. The answer incorrectly suggests s 26 applies partially.",
          "D": "While the phrase 'who are living at my death' does indicate who qualifies for the class (survivors only), this does not create a 'contrary intention' that would override s 26 - rather, it makes this a class gift that s 26 does not apply to in the first place. The notes state s 26 applies 'unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will' - this refers to situations where children are named but the will includes a gift-over or other provision showing the testator does not want s 26's default (gift to issue) to apply. Here, there is no need to reach 'contrary intention' because s 26 does not apply to class gifts at all. The phrase 'living at my death' is part of the class definition, not an indication about s 26.

Actually, I need to reconsider this. Section 26 states the gift 'shall take effect as if the death of that person had happened immediately after the death of the testator' - this creates a legal fiction. The practical operation is that Alice is deemed to have survived the testator long enough to inherit her one-third, then immediately died. When Alice dies, her one-third goes to Alice's estate for distribution. But wait - the notes indicate Alice's children (issue) receive, not the estate generally. Let me reread s 26 more carefully. The notes say: 'S 26 also applies to T's grandchildren and their issues as named beneficiaries (since it covers \"child or other issue\")' and 'gift goes to deceased child's estate for distribution.' The mechanics are: Alice is deemed to have survived, inherited one-third, then died. Her one-third is distributed according to her will or intestacy.

So the grandchildren receive through Alice's estate, but the practical effect is they share equally.",

If Alice had a will leaving everything to her spouse, the one-third might go to the spouse. If Alice died intestate with a spouse and children, ISA would divide between spouse and children. If Alice died intestate with children only (no spouse), the children get it all. The answer is not wrong per se, but answer B more directly captures the likely practical result (Alice's children receive) which is what most testators intend when they make gifts to children who predecease leaving issue.",

Because the children are named, this is not a class gift, so the class gift lapse-and-redistribute rule does not apply. Instead, s 26 applies, preventing lapse and giving the gift to Alice's issue.

Section 26 provides that the gift 'shall take effect as if the death of that person had happened immediately after the death of the testator.'

If Alice had a spouse, the spouse might receive part under ISA (50% if there are children). But the notes seem to suggest the issue (children) receive, not the spouse. The notes state: 'S 26 also applies to T's grandchildren and their issues' - suggesting grandchildren are the recipients. If the spouse could take part of the share through Alice's estate, this might not align with the testator's intention (testator wanted to benefit descendants, not children's spouses).

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The children receive nothing because the residue is exhausted. A residuary gift is a gift of what remains after all debts, expenses, and specific gifts are paid. The notes explain: 'Residuary estate is usually used to pay debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, estate taxes and legacies' and 'Residuary gifts (gift of residue) - \"catch all\" provision for all property of T that has not been specifically provided for in the will.' Here, the estate's priority of payment is: (1) debts and funeral expenses, (2) specific gift of $100,000 to charity, (3) residue to children. After (1) and (2) are paid, nothing remains for (3). The children's gift is of the residue - by definition, this is what remains after everything else. If nothing remains, the children receive nothing. This is not unfair or unexpected - the testator made a specific gift of $100,000 that had priority over the residuary gift. If the testator wanted to ensure the children received something, the testator should have: (1) made specific gifts to children in addition to residue, or (2) conditioned the charity gift ('$100,000 to charity if my estate exceeds $200,000'), or (3) given children and charity as co-residuary beneficiaries.",

The notes indicate: 'Residuary estate is usually used to pay debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, estate taxes and legacies.' This means specific legacies (like the $100,000 gift) are paid FROM the residuary estate, and residuary beneficiaries receive only what remains after paying these items. The children cannot 'share' the $100,000 charity gift because that gift has priority. The charity receives its $100,000, and the children receive the residue (which is zero). If the answer were correct (residuary beneficiaries sharing specific gifts when residue is exhausted), this would undermine the priority system. Specific gifts would never be secure - they could be reduced to benefit residuary beneficiaries. The law protects specific gifts by giving them priority.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because abatement operates in the opposite direction - residuary gifts are abated first, then specific gifts. The notes on abatement explain: 'If there is insufficient money to pay cash gifts, then the legacies are reduced and each beneficiary takes PARI PASSU.' But the hierarchy is: debts/expenses paid first (from residue), then specific gifts, then whatever remains is residue. If the entire estate is insufficient to pay both specific gifts and leave residue, the residue bears the burden (gets nothing) before specific gifts are touched. Only if there were insufficient assets to pay even the specific gifts would those gifts be abated. Here, there is enough to pay the $100,000 charity gift (it was paid), just nothing left for residue. The charity gift is not abated - the residue is exhausted. The answer incorrectly suggests specific gifts should be reduced to provide residue.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the estate does not pass by intestacy when the residue is exhausted. The will remains valid and effective. The specific gifts are distributed according to the will (charity gets $100,000). The residuary gift is also given effect - it is a gift of the residue, and the residue is zero, so the residuary beneficiaries (children) receive zero. This is different from intestacy. Intestacy occurs when: (1) there is no will (total intestacy), or (2) the will fails to dispose of some property (partial intestacy). Here, the will does dispose of the residue ('to my children') - it is just that the residue is zero. A gift of zero is still a testamentary disposition, not intestacy. If the will had no residuary clause and property remained, that would be partial intestacy. But here, there is a residuary clause, and no property remains undisposed.

Since the will is silent about the mortgage, s 26(1) applies: Diana takes subject to mortgage. Additionally, the ambulatory principle means the house at death (worth $1.5M with $100K mortgage) is what Diana receives, not the house as it existed at execution ($1M with $300K mortgage).

This means the will is assessed as of death, not execution. Property appreciation or depreciation between execution and death is for the beneficiary's account (benefit or loss). Here, the house appreciated from $1M to $1.5M. Diana receives the house as it exists at death ($1.5M value), not as it existed at execution ($1M).

The key distinction is between: (1) Trust nominations under s 132 - create an irrevocable trust, cannot be affected by wills, proceeds do not form part of estate, and (2) Revocable nominations under s 133 - can be revoked by wills meeting certain conditions per s 133(7)(b). Here, the testator made a TRUST nomination, not a revocable nomination. Section 133(7)(b) (which allows wills to revoke nominations) specifically states: 'REVOCABLE NOMINATION (can be affected by will): s 133 does not apply to trust nomination, unless revoked in accordance with s 132(7) into revocable nomination (s 133(1) IA).'

Section 132 trust nominations are protected from revocation by will. The policy is that once a trust nomination is made, beneficial interest vests in the trust beneficiaries (children here), and the policy owner cannot unilaterally revoke through a will. If wills could revoke trust nominations, there would be no meaningful distinction between trust and revocable nominations - both would be revocable by will. The law creates this distinction to allow policy owners to make irrevocable provision for beneficiaries (trust nomination) or flexible provision (revocable nomination). Here, having chosen trust nomination, the testator cannot revoke by will. The answer incorrectly applies s 133(7)(b) to trust nominations.",

The notes state: 's 133 does not apply to trust nomination, unless revoked in accordance with s 132(7).' Section 132(7) likely sets out specific procedures for revoking trust nominations (not through wills). Even if the testator wanted to change beneficiaries from children to wife, the testator would need to: (1) revoke the trust nomination per s 132(7), (2) possibly convert it to a revocable nomination or make a new one. The will alone cannot revoke. The answer is correct that separate revocation is needed, but the question is whether the will can do it, and the answer is no - will alone is insufficient.",

While trust nominations create vested beneficial interests in the named beneficiaries, the policy owner retains the power to revoke (per s 132(7) procedures). Beneficiaries do not have veto power over revocation. If consent were required, trust nominations would be truly irrevocable, which is not the case - they can be revoked, just not by will.

There was no reason why the rule against restraints on alienation, which typically applied to real property, should not also apply to personalty.' A restraint on alienation is a condition that prohibits or penalizes the beneficiary from selling, transferring, or otherwise disposing of the gifted property. Such restraints are void as against public policy because they interfere with the free marketability of property. Here, the clause states that if the daughter 'parts with or disposes of her interest, her share shall be forfeited' - this is a classic restraint on alienation. It penalizes the daughter for selling by forfeiting her interest. Even though framed as a 'condition subsequent' (daughter receives property, then loses it if she sells), this is void. If such clauses were valid, property could be indefinitely restricted from market transactions. The law favors free alienability. The daughter receives the property and can sell it without forfeiture.",

The notes from Lau Tyng Tyng state: 'Even if the testator had intended... as a condition subsequent... it would nevertheless be invalid or unenforceable at law for being void as a restraint upon alienation.' The law distinguishes between valid conditions subsequent (e.g., 'to my daughter, but if she does not graduate from university, to my son' - condition about conduct unrelated to property disposition) and invalid restraints on alienation (conditions about selling or disposing of the property). The latter are void regardless of how they are structured. Here, the condition is 'if my daughter parts with or disposes of' - directly restraining alienation. This is void. The answer incorrectly validates a restraint on alienation merely because it is a condition subsequent.",

The notes from Lau Tyng Tyng indicate that restraints on alienation are void 'at law' - they are void as a matter of legal principle, not based on unclear drafting. Even if the testator very clearly and expressly stated 'I absolutely forbid my daughter from ever selling this property, and if she does, it is forfeited to my son' with utmost clarity, this would still be void as a restraint on alienation. The problem is not ambiguity but the substantive rule against restraints. Public policy favors free alienability of property. Allowing testators to tie up property with alienation restrictions would harm the economy and property markets. No matter how clear the testator's intention, the law will not enforce restraints on alienation. The answer incorrectly suggests clarity cures the invalidity.",
          "D": "This answer is partially correct (daughter can do as she wishes, no forfeiture) but for incomplete reasoning. It is not that 'the daughter received absolutely' (actually, she received on trust for her benefit, then in possession) - rather, the forfeiture clause is void as a restraint on alienation. Even if the daughter received on trust (not absolutely), she cannot be penalized for selling or disposing of her interest. The notes from Lau Tyng Tyng apply the restraint on alienation principle to both real property and personalty, and to both absolute gifts and trust interests. The answer reaches the right result (daughter can sell without forfeiture) but does not clearly explain that the reason is the restraint on alienation doctrine."

Here, there is no nomination (neither trust nor revocable). Therefore, s 133(8)(a) does not apply. The next step is s 133(8)(b): if the will disposes of the death benefits, the will controls. The question states the will 'gives his entire estate to his children, with no mention of insurance policies.' 'Entire estate' might be broad enough to include policy proceeds if they form part of the estate (which they do for policies after 1 Sep 2009 without trust nominations). If so, the children receive under the will. However, if the will does not sufficiently dispose of the death benefits (e.g., if 'entire estate' is interpreted narrowly not to include insurance proceeds), then s 133(8)(c) applies: the proceeds are distributed according to ISA.

Section 133(8) Insurance Act provides a waterfall: (a) nomination, (b) will, (c) ISA. The proceeds go under the will only if the will 'provides for the disposition of all death benefits.' Here, the will gives 'entire estate' which probably includes the proceeds, but there is interpretive uncertainty ('with no mention of insurance policies'). If the will does not sufficiently dispose of death benefits, ISA applies per s 133(8)(c). The answer assumes the will automatically covers proceeds without considering the s 133(8) framework.

        "correct": "The son receives the shares and the daughter's cash gift is abated. Specific gifts of property (like shares) and general pecuniary legacies (like cash) are treated differently. The son's gift is a specific legacy of identified shares ('my ABC Company shares'). The daughter's gift is a general pecuniary legacy ($300,000 cash). The notes explain abatement: 'If there is insufficient money to pay cash gifts, then the legacies are reduced and each beneficiary takes PARI PASSU.' The son's shares are a specific asset that passes to him without reduction (unless there are insufficient assets in the entire estate to pay debts, in which case even specific gifts might be reached, but that is not the case here). The daughter's $300,000 cash legacy is a general gift that must be satisfied from estate cash. Only $100,000 cash remains after debts. Therefore, the daughter's gift is abated to $100,000. The son is unaffected - he receives the shares worth $300,000. The ambulatory nature principle (s 19 WA) means the shares are valued at death ($300,000), not at execution ($100,000), for purposes of assessing the son's benefit, but this does not trigger equalization or abatement of his gift.",

The testator has testamentary freedom to give different amounts to different beneficiaries. Here, the testator gave shares to the son and $300,000 cash to the daughter. If the shares were worth $100,000 at execution, the testator may have intended approximately equal gifts (shares $100K, cash $300K - though still unequal). The shares' appreciation to $300,000 benefits the son through the ambulatory nature principle - gifts are assessed at death. The daughter was promised $300,000 cash, but her gift is abated to $100,000 due to insufficient cash. This results in unequal distribution (son gets $300K worth of shares, daughter gets $100K cash), but this is the effect of ademption/abatement rules, not unfairness. The executor cannot sell the son's shares to equalize - the will gave specific shares to the son, and they must be delivered to him. The answer invents an equalization requirement.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the daughter has no claim against the son for the shortfall in her gift. Abatement means the daughter's gift is reduced due to insufficient cash in the estate - she receives less than promised, but this is a reduction of her gift, not a claim against other beneficiaries. The son received his gift (shares) under the will. The daughter cannot sue the son or claim from his shares. Each beneficiary takes their gift as provided in the will, subject to abatement if insufficient assets exist. If the daughter wanted to challenge the distribution, she would need to: (1) argue the will was invalid, (2) claim under Inheritance (Family Provision) Act if she qualifies as a dependent, or (3) show the executor mismanaged the estate (wasted cash). But she has no claim against the son as a co-beneficiary. The answer incorrectly creates a claim between beneficiaries.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because specific gifts (shares) and general legacies (cash) are not abated proportionately together. The notes discuss abatement of 'cash gifts' and 'legacies' taking 'PARI PASSU' - but this refers to multiple cash legacies or general legacies being abated proportionately among themselves. Specific gifts (of identified property like shares) are in a different category. The typical order of abatement is: (1) residuary gifts abate first, (2) general legacies abate next, (3) specific gifts abate last. Here, the son has a specific gift (shares) and the daughter has a general legacy (cash). The daughter's gift abates due to insufficient cash; the son's shares are unaffected.

The notes explain: 'Presumption of Resulting trust: \"where a transfer of property to another takes place for which the recipient does not provide the whole of the consideration\"' (Chan Yuen Lan at [47]). Here, the testator contributed $600,000 (60%) and the sister contributed $400,000 (40%) - unequal contributions. This creates a presumption of resulting trust: the testator has 60% beneficial interest, the sister has 40%. The notes state: 'Presumption of advancement can rebut presumption of resulting trust... Traditional categories: \"joint tenants are spouses\", and \"other pre-existing relationships which attract the operation of the presumption of advancement (such as parent-child relationships)\"' (Lau Siew Kim at [107]). Siblings are not mentioned as a traditional category. While advancement could theoretically extend to siblings in some contexts, this is not established. Without advancement, the resulting trust stands: testator has 60% beneficial interest as tenant in common (despite being legal joint tenant). The will can dispose of this 60% beneficial interest to the son. The mechanics: (1) legal title passes to sister by survivorship, (2) sister holds 60% on resulting trust for the son per the will, (3) sister retains 40% beneficially.",

The examples given are spouses and parent-child. Siblings are not mentioned. While the notes say advancement depends on 'a holistic examination of all the facts' and might be extended to other relationships based on 'contemporary norms' (Lau Siew Kim at [60]), there is no indication that sibling relationships automatically attract advancement. Without advancement, the resulting trust (based on 60-40 contribution) stands unrebutted. The answer incorrectly extends advancement to siblings.",
          "C": "This inverts the analysis. With unequal contribution ($600K vs $400K), a resulting trust arises presumptively giving the testator 60% beneficial interest. The testator does not need to prove intent to retain this interest - it is presumed from the contribution. The burden would be on the sister to rebut the resulting trust by proving advancement (which is unlikely for siblings) or actual intention that the testator gifted the 60% to her despite contributing more. The notes from Chan Yuen Lan explain that the resulting trust is a presumption that arises automatically from unequal contribution, rebuttable by showing actual intention to benefit the recipient. Here, without evidence of such intention, the resulting trust stands. The answer incorrectly places the burden on the son to prove the testator's retained interest when this is presumed.",
          "D": "This is incorrect for two reasons. First, joint tenancy does not automatically mean equal beneficial interests - beneficial interests can differ from legal title based on resulting trust.

Second, even though the sister receives legal title by survivorship (correct on that point), if she holds 60% on resulting trust for the son (testator's beneficial interest per the will), she does not receive all beneficially.

This trust vests beneficial interest in those beneficiaries. The notes indicate that subsequent divorce does not defeat this vested interest. The former wife remains entitled to the policy proceeds under the s 73 trust despite the divorce. The policy rationale might be that the trust vested when the policy was effected (creating property rights for beneficiaries), and those rights cannot be unilaterally defeated by the subsequent divorce. If the testator wanted to exclude the former wife after divorce, the testator should have: (1) cancelled the policy and taken out a new one (with different beneficiaries), or (2) if possible under the policy terms and s 73, changed beneficiaries before divorce.

The policy might be that s 73 creates vested beneficial interests that cannot be defeated by subsequent changes in marital status. The beneficiary's rights arose when the policy was effected and the trust created. Divorce does not divest those rights. If automatic revocation upon divorce were the rule, beneficiaries would have uncertain rights dependent on the insured's future marital status. The answer incorrectly assumes automatic revocation.",

The notes from Dolly Eng indicate the trust continues despite divorce, regardless of what the divorce proceedings addressed. If the divorce decree purported to transfer the wife's interest in the policy to the husband or to extinguish it, this might create a separate question of whether the decree can override the statutory trust.

This does not address the question. Furthermore, the notes suggest s 73 trusts may be difficult to revoke - they are statutory trusts that arise automatically.

Here, the death benefits are $120,000, which is below the $150,000 threshold. The insurance company can pay to the nominee (if there is one) or to the beneficiaries entitled under the will or intestacy without requiring production of a grant. This is a practical accommodation that speeds up distribution of insurance proceeds. If the death benefits exceeded $150,000, then a grant would be required before payment. The threshold balances: (1) efficiency and speed for smaller amounts, and (2) protection and oversight for larger amounts requiring a grant.",

While the general rule is that estate assets can only be released to personal representatives who have obtained a grant (executors with probate, administrators with LA), insurance proceeds are special. The notes state: 'Insurance companies can pay up to S$150K without grant of probate or letters of administration (IA s 150(2)).' This exception recognizes that insurance policies often name specific beneficiaries, and requiring a grant before payment would delay distribution unnecessarily for smaller amounts. Banks and other institutions typically do require a grant before releasing assets, but insurance companies have this statutory exception. The answer incorrectly states an absolute rule when there is an exception.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because there is no requirement for beneficiary consent under s 150(2). The section allows insurance companies to pay 'without grant' up to $150,000 - it does not impose additional conditions like obtaining consent. The insurance company would pay according to: (1) the nomination (if there is one), (2) the will (if no nomination), or (3) intestacy rules (if no nomination or will). The insurance company would need to satisfy itself about who is entitled (perhaps by seeing a copy of the will, or intestacy entitlements), but does not need formal consent from all beneficiaries. If consent were required, this would slow down the process and defeat the purpose of the s 150(2) exception (allowing quick payment without grants). The answer invents a consent requirement.",

The insurance company can pay up to $150,000 without any court involvement - no application, no order, no authorization needed. The section is a statutory authorization that allows insurance companies to pay moderate amounts without the formality of grants or court orders. If court authorization were required, this would negate the efficiency benefit of s 150(2) - the insurance company and beneficiaries would have to go to court, which might take as long as obtaining a grant. The purpose of s 150(2) is to avoid such delays for smaller amounts. The answer incorrectly requires court involvement when the statute allows self-execution by insurance companies."

This duty would be subject to the court's purview, and was not only limited to instances where there had been bad faith on the trustee's part.' Here, the executors are directed to sell, but they have discretion about timing if market conditions are poor. However, this discretion must be exercised reasonably in the beneficiaries' interests.

Whether a court should intervene in the decision of the trustee was fact-sensitive and would ultimately be dictated by the demands of justice of the case.' Executors cannot postpone sales indefinitely or for their own convenience. The power to postpone must be exercised in the beneficiaries' interests.

The notes from Foo Jee Seng address trusts for sale with power to postpone, but even without express power to postpone, executors have some discretion about timing. Immediate sale regardless of market conditions might waste estate assets (selling at a loss in a depressed market when waiting a few months could achieve better prices). Executors have fiduciary duties to act in beneficiaries' interests, which includes prudent timing of sales. However, the discretion is not unlimited - it must be exercised reasonably. If executors delay unreasonably, beneficiaries can seek court intervention. The answer incorrectly mandates immediate sale without any discretion.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because express power to postpone is not always required, though it is helpful. The notes from Foo Jee Seng discuss 'a trustee of a trust for sale was accorded the power to postpone sale as he thought fit' - this refers to an express power in the will. When such power exists, the trustee has discretion (subject to reasonableness). But even without express power, trustees/executors may have implied discretion to choose the timing of sales as part of prudent estate administration. The will directs 'sell my house' but does not specify 'sell immediately' or set a deadline. Executors can exercise reasonable discretion about timing. If they postpone unreasonably, the court can intervene per Foo Jee Seng. Express power to postpone gives clearer discretion, but is not absolutely required for any postponement. The answer incorrectly suggests no discretion exists without express power."

Here, the son already owns another HDB flat, making him ineligible under s 50(1). HDB has refused consent under s 59(1), so the flat cannot be transferred to the son. However, the testator's intention was to benefit the son with the flat. The executor should honor this intention as far as possible by selling the flat and giving the sale proceeds to the son. This achieves the economic substance of the testator's intention (son receives the value of the flat) even though the strict terms (son receives the flat itself) cannot be met due to regulatory restrictions.

However, general principles suggest they are problematic. No-contest clauses deter beneficiaries from challenging wills even when challenges are meritorious (e.g., will procured by fraud, undue influence, or testator lacked capacity). Public policy favors allowing legitimate challenges to invalid wills. If no-contest clauses were enforceable, invalid wills could be insulated from challenge by threatening forfeiture. Beneficiaries would face a Hobson's choice: accept an invalid will, or challenge and lose everything if the challenge fails. This is particularly problematic when the challenge concerns fundamental validity (capacity, fraud, forgery).

Similar to restraints on alienation (which are void even if drafted as conditions subsequent per Lau Tyng Tyng), no-contest clauses may be void as against public policy even if technically structured as valid conditions. Public policy considerations (access to justice, preventing enforcement of invalid wills) may override the testator's intention to include a no-contest clause.

Furthermore, if the challenge succeeds (e.g., will is invalid due to lack of capacity), the entire will including the no-contest clause fails, so forfeiture is moot. If the challenge fails (will is valid), should the no-contest clause be enforced? This is questionable - the beneficiary exercised their right to challenge, the court has validated the will, and punishing the challenger seems harsh. Singapore law on this is unclear from the notes, but the answer's conditional enforceability is problematic.",

No-contest clauses operate by their own terms as conditions in the will. If enforceable, they apply automatically when a beneficiary contests - forfeiture occurs by operation of the clause, not based on whether other beneficiaries want to enforce it. If consent were required, the clause would be ineffective (beneficiaries would need to agree to forfeit a co-beneficiary's share, which they might not do out of family harmony or fairness). The answer invents a consent requirement. The real issue is whether such clauses are enforceable at all as a matter of law and public policy, not whether beneficiaries consent to enforcement."

The case of Saniah Ali held that nominated CPF moneys 'do not form part of the estate of the deceased' and are not subject to distribution under the will or intestacy. The CPF nomination operates as a separate mechanism for distributing CPF, independent from the will. When the testator makes a CPF nomination, the CPF passes directly to the nominee outside the estate. The will disposes of 'the estate' to the daughter - but CPF is not part of 'the estate,' so the will does not affect it. Result: the son receives the CPF (per nomination), the daughter receives the estate (per will). This is not a conflict - they are two separate pots of assets distributed by two different mechanisms.

Therefore, the will does not override the CPF nomination. If wills could override CPF nominations, the CPF nomination system would be pointless - everyone's CPF would go according to their wills, making nominations irrelevant. The law treats CPF nominations as separate from wills, each operating in its own sphere. The answer incorrectly suggests wills override nominations.",

If the will were executed after the nomination, this does not revoke the nomination (except for revocable insurance nominations under s 133(7)(b) IA, which has specific requirements - not applicable to CPF).

If the testator wanted both son and daughter to receive CPF, the testator should have: (1) nominated both in the CPF nomination (e.g., 50-50 split), or (2) not nominated anyone, letting CPF go to the estate where the will would distribute it to the daughter.

          "A": "This is incorrect because acknowledging a statutory restriction does not create authority to violate it. The testator stating 'no trust can be created' shows awareness of s 58 HDA, but then attempting to create a trust anyway ('I give the flat to my trustees to hold on trust') violates s 58. Acknowledgment is not consent or waiver - the restriction is statutory, not contractual. The testator cannot consent to violating HDB regulations. HDB approval is required, not testator acknowledgment. If the testator wanted a trust over the HDB flat, the proper procedure is to apply to HDB for approval to create a trust before or after death. The will stating the restriction does not satisfy this requirement. The answer incorrectly treats acknowledgment as authorization.",
          "C": "While HDB approval could make the trust effective, the answer does not address the current effectiveness. Section 58 states trusts cannot be created 'without HDB's approval' - the prohibition is unless approval is obtained. If the executor applies to HDB after death and HDB approves, then the trust could proceed. But this is uncertain and discretionary. HDB may refuse approval. The answer is partially correct that approval could validate the trust, but the question asks 'is this trust provision effective' - without approval (not indicated in the facts), it is not effective. Answer B more directly addresses the current status: invalid without approval. Furthermore, obtaining HDB approval for trust arrangements is rare and difficult - HDB generally prefers straightforward ownership.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because it treats the testator's acknowledgment ('no trust can be created') as a substantive revocation of the subsequent trust provision. More likely, the testator was acknowledging the s 58 restriction while attempting to create a trust anyway (perhaps hoping HDB would approve, or not fully understanding the restriction). If the clause were 'no trust can be created, AND I DO NOT create any trust' this would negate the later provision. But stating the restriction then attempting a trust suggests the testator wanted a trust despite the restriction. However, the real reason the trust is ineffective is not the testator's acknowledgment, but s 58 HDA's statutory prohibition. Whether or not the testator acknowledged the restriction, s 58 applies. The answer incorrectly focuses on the testator's statement rather than the statutory prohibition."

Three months after the grant of probate, the testator's son discovers an error: the will gives 'my house at 123 Maple Road' to his sister, but the testator told the solicitor it should go to the son, and the solicitor mistakenly wrote 'sister.' Can the son apply to rectify the will?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes, because the will expressly authorizes rectification of clerical errors.",

        "D": "No, because wills cannot be rectified after probate has been granted."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The son can apply for rectification under s 28 Wills Act. The notes state: 'Rectification of error (s 28 WA): (1) A court may order that a will be rectified so as to carry out the testator's intentions, if the court is satisfied that, as a consequence of either or both of the following, the will is so expressed that the will fails to carry out the testator's intentions: (a) a clerical error; (b) a failure to understand the testator's instructions. (2) Except with the permission of a court, an application for an order under subsection (1) must be made no later than 6 months after the date on which a grant authorising the administration of the testator's estate is first made - i.e. within 6 months of grant of probate / LA.' Here, there is a failure to understand the testator's instructions (or clerical error): the testator told the solicitor 'son' but the solicitor wrote 'sister.' This is exactly what s 28 is designed to correct. The son discovered the error 3 months after the grant, which is within the 6-month limitation period. Therefore, the son can apply under s 28(1). The court can order rectification if satisfied that: (1) there was a clerical error or failure to understand instructions, and (2) the will as written fails to carry out the testator's intentions.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This answer reaches the correct result (rectification is possible) but for the wrong reason. The power to rectify comes from s 28 Wills Act (statutory power), not from the testator's clause in the will authorizing rectification. The testator cannot grant the court power to rectify - the court's power comes from statute. The clause in the will expressing desire for rectification might be evidence of the testator's intentions (helpful in the rectification application), but it does not create the legal basis for rectification. Section 28 sets the requirements: clerical error or failure to understand instructions, application within 6 months (or with leave), and proof that the will fails to carry out intentions. If these are satisfied, rectification is possible regardless of what the will says about it. If the will had no such clause, rectification would still be available under s 28. The answer incorrectly treats the will's clause as the source of rectification power.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because it reverses the timing. The notes state: 'an application for an order under subsection (1) must be made no later than 6 months after the date on which a grant... is first made.' This means the son has UP TO 6 months from the grant to apply. Here, only 3 months have passed since the grant. The son is still within the 6-month period and can apply. The answer incorrectly suggests the 6-month period has expired when it has not. Perhaps the answer confused the timing, suggesting 3 months have passed and therefore too late - but the limit is 6 months, so 3 months means there are 3 months remaining. Furthermore, even if the 6-month period expired, s 28(2) allows late applications 'with the permission of a court' - so rectification might still be possible beyond 6 months with leave.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because rectification is specifically designed to be available after probate. The notes state the application must be made 'within 6 months of grant of probate / LA' - this presupposes that probate has been granted and rectification occurs afterward. If rectification were not possible after probate, the time limit would make no sense (it would say 'before grant' not 'within 6 months after grant'). The purpose of s 28 is to correct errors after the will has been admitted to probate but before significant distribution has occurred. This allows errors to be fixed while minimizing disruption to estate administration. If rectification were only possible before probate, many errors would go uncorrected (errors often discovered during administration, not before). The answer incorrectly prohibits post-probate rectification."

When property is held as joint tenants, the right of survivorship applies upon one joint tenant's death - the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) regardless of wills. The testator and partner registered as joint tenants, so survivorship applies. The testator's will attempting to give 'my share' is ineffective because: (1) joint tenancy means no separate 'shares' (unity of ownership), and (2) wills cannot sever joint tenancy. The partnership agreement stating that partnership assets belong to surviving partners is consistent with (and perhaps reinforces) the survivorship effect, but the legal mechanism is the joint tenancy itself. The children receive nothing from this property.",

          "A": "This is incorrect because joint tenancy cannot be severed by will. The notes state: 'a will CANNOT sever joint tenancy (s 35(1) CLPA).' Even though the testator contributed 50%, which might create a 50% beneficial interest under resulting trust principles in other contexts, here the property was registered as joint tenants. The notes explain that to sever joint tenancy requires: 'deed (for unregistered land) (CLPA s 66A) or instrument of declaration in approved form (for registered land) (LTA s 53(5)) and serving copy on other joint tenants.' Without such severance during the testator's lifetime, the joint tenancy remains intact.

The answer ignores the joint tenancy and survivorship effect.",

Partnership agreements can affect how property is characterized and what happens to it. Here, the partnership agreement 'states all partnership assets belong to the partnership and surviving partners' - this reinforces that the property is partnership property and surviving partners take. The fact that legal title is held as joint tenants is entirely consistent with the partnership agreement. Joint tenancy is the typical way partners hold partnership property (to facilitate survivorship to continuing partners). The partnership agreement does not prevent survivorship - it supports it. The answer incorrectly suggests partnership agreements and joint tenancy are incompatible.",
          "D": "This answer is partially correct that partnership agreements matter, but the division is through survivorship, not some other mechanism. Partnership property held as joint tenants passes by survivorship to surviving partners. This IS the partnership agreement being given effect (surviving partners get the property, as the agreement states). The 'division' is not a 50-50 split to the estate and surviving partner, but 100% to the surviving partner via survivorship. The partnership agreement and joint tenancy work together to achieve this result. If the partnership agreement required some other division (e.g., deceased partner's estate gets 50%, surviving partner gets 50%), the partners should have held as tenants in common, not joint tenants. The answer creates a false dichotomy between partnership agreement and survivorship when they are aligned."

The notes explain: 'Ambulatory nature of wills (Section 19 WA)... will \"to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will\" (WA s 19) - i.e. upon death of testator.' When the will gives 'all my shares' in GHI Company, this is interpreted as of the testator's death, not execution. At death, the testator owns 10,000 shares (after the stock split). The daughter receives all 10,000. Stock splits are corporate actions that increase the number of shares while maintaining proportionate ownership. The testator's 5,000 shares became 10,000 shares (each new share worth half of the old shares, maintaining total value). The gift of 'all my shares' captures all shares owned at death, including additional shares from stock splits, dividends (stock dividends), or other corporate actions. The daughter benefits from all changes to the shares between execution and death.",

Section 19 WA provides that wills speak as of death, not execution. If the gift were frozen at execution, changes to property between execution and death (appreciation, depreciation, stock splits, dividends, etc.) would not benefit or burden the beneficiary. This would be impractical - it would require tracking the property's state at execution and somehow reversing any changes before distribution. The law avoids this by making wills speak as of death. The gift is 'all my shares' - at death, the testator has 10,000 shares, so the daughter receives 10,000. The number at execution is irrelevant. The answer incorrectly applies execution-date valuation.",
          "C": "This is confused and impractical. It suggests the daughter gets half the shares (5,000) and the value of the other half (5,000) in cash. This creates an arbitrary division with no legal basis. The will gives 'all my shares' - not 'half my shares and cash equivalent of the other half.' Furthermore, after a stock split, there are not really 'original' and 'additional' shares - all 10,000 shares are fungible and identical. The split simply increased the number while decreasing the per-share value proportionately. Giving 5,000 shares plus cash value of 5,000 shares would roughly double the daughter's benefit (she'd get 5,000 shares worth X, plus cash worth another X), which is not the testator's intention. The answer invents a splitting mechanism that makes no sense.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because gifts of shares are gifts of the shares themselves, not of a fixed value. The notes do not support value-based interpretation of share gifts. When the will gives 'all my shares,' the daughter receives all shares owned at death (10,000), regardless of their value. If the shares appreciated or depreciated in total value between execution and death, this is for the daughter's benefit or burden. Similarly, a stock split changes the number of shares but maintains total value - the daughter gets all shares at death (10,000). Locking in the value at execution would require the executor to somehow adjust (sell some shares if they appreciated, or add cash if they depreciated) to maintain execution-date value. This is not how wills operate. The answer incorrectly imposes value-based distribution when share gifts are quantity-based."

Divorce is an altered circumstance but it does NOT invalidate the will... No will shall be revoked by any presumption of an intention on the ground of an alteration in circumstances (WA s 14).' The same principle applies to citizenship changes. The will remains valid. The statement 'I am a citizen of Singapore' was true when made (in 1995) and served to identify the testator.

If changing circumstances (like citizenship) invalidated wills containing descriptive statements, many wills would fail unnecessarily. Testators commonly include identifying information (address, occupation, citizenship) that may change over years or decades. The will's validity depends on compliance with execution formalities (s 5-6 WA: in writing, signed, witnessed), not on the continued accuracy of descriptive statements. As long as the will can be identified as the testator's will (through name, date, etc.), minor inaccuracies in descriptive details are immaterial.

The testator's later change of citizenship is not a clerical error in the will but a changed circumstance. Section 28 is not designed for updating outdated factual statements; it is for correcting mistakes in drafting. Furthermore, the citizenship statement is not a substantive disposition that needs correction - it is merely identifying information. The will's dispositive provisions (who gets what) are unaffected by the citizenship statement's accuracy. Rectification is unnecessary.

The testator could have executed a codicil or new will after becoming Malaysian, but failure to do so does not invalidate the existing will.

While this is somewhat general language (not 'my Honda Civic registration number XXX'), in context, 'my car' likely refers to the car the testator owned at execution (the Honda). When the testator traded in the Honda for the Mercedes, the Honda was disposed of. At death, the Honda no longer exists. Therefore, the gift adeems. The Mercedes is a different car, not covered by the description 'my car' as it existed at execution. This is similar to the gift of 'my property at 15 Newton Road' - when that specific property is sold and replaced with property at a different address, the gift adeems. Here, 'my car' (the Honda) was disposed of and replaced with a different car (Mercedes). Ademption applies strictly: the gift fails.

The question is whether 'my car' is sufficiently general to cover any car owned at death, or sufficiently specific to refer to a particular car (the Honda). If 'my car' is general like 'my primary residence' (which might cover whichever house the testator lives in at death), the Mercedes might pass. But if 'my car' refers to a specific car (the Honda), then disposal of that car causes ademption. The safer answer based on the notes is ademption (B), treating 'my car' as referring to a specific vehicle that was disposed of. The answer might be correct under an ambulatory interpretation, but this is less certain.",

There is no inquiry into whether the testator intended replacement property to satisfy the gift. If such intent mattered, the strict rule of ademption would become a flexible inquiry into testator's purposes, creating uncertainty. The rule is: specific property gone = ademption. The testator's reasons for disposing (needed money, wanted a better car, etc.) are irrelevant. If the testator wanted the nephew to receive whatever car the testator owned, the will should say 'my motor vehicle at my death' or 'whatever car I own.' With 'my car' (likely referring to the Honda), when that car is gone, ademption applies. The answer invents an intent-based exception to ademption.",

The gift was of the car itself (property), not of value (money). If the testator wanted the nephew to receive value rather than specific property, the will should give a cash amount ('$30,000 to my nephew' - general pecuniary legacy).

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The mother likely receives 100% by survivorship because there is no presumption of advancement from child to parent. The notes state: 'Presumption of advancement can rebut presumption of resulting trust... Traditional categories: \"joint tenants are spouses\", and \"other pre-existing relationships which attract the operation of the presumption of advancement (such as parent-child relationships)\"' (Lau Siew Kim at [107]). The traditional presumption of advancement applies from PARENT to child (father/mother giving to son/daughter), not from child to parent. When a child transfers property to a parent, the traditional view is that no presumption of advancement arises - instead, a resulting trust arises from the child's contribution. However, the mother is the legal joint tenant with right of survivorship. Even if a resulting trust gives the testator beneficial interest (mother holds on trust for testator), the will cannot dispose of this beneficial interest because legal joint tenancy means the will cannot sever (s 35(1) CLPA). The mother gets legal title by survivorship. Whether she also gets beneficial ownership, or holds 100% on resulting trust for the testator's estate, depends on whether advancement can apply in reverse (child to parent). The notes do not clearly address this, but the traditional view is no advancement in reverse.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "While a resulting trust likely arises (testator paid 100%, mother paid nothing), making the testator 100% beneficial owner, the will still cannot dispose of this beneficial interest because of the joint tenancy. Section 35(1) CLPA states: 'a will CANNOT sever joint tenancy.' Even if the testator has 100% beneficial interest held as tenant in common (while legal title is joint tenancy), the will is ineffective to transfer beneficial interest when legal title is joint. The mother receives legal title by survivorship, and if she holds on resulting trust for the estate, the children might claim through the estate, but not directly 'under the will' as the answer suggests. The mechanics are complex. Answer C more accurately captures the survivorship effect.",
          "B": "This incorrectly suggests presumption of advancement applies from child to parent. The notes focus on advancement from parent to child: 'Traditional categories: \"joint tenants are spouses\", and \"other pre-existing relationships which attract the operation of the presumption of advancement (such as parent-child relationships).\"' The examples in Lau Siew Kim, Low Gim Siah, and Chye Seng Kai all involve parents giving to children or spouses giving to spouses. There is no clear authority for advancement in reverse (child to parent). The traditional common law view is that advancement applies only in relationships where the donor has a moral obligation to provide for the donee (parent to child, husband to wife historically). Children do not have such obligation to parents traditionally (though contemporary norms may be changing, and Maintenance of Parents Act creates some obligations). The answer incorrectly extends advancement from child to parent.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because joint tenancy at law does not automatically mean equal beneficial interests, and more fundamentally, misunderstands how survivorship works. First, beneficial interests can differ from legal title based on resulting trust - even with legal joint tenancy, beneficial interests might be held as tenants in common based on contributions. The notes state: 'Framework of analysis same as for property set out in Lau Siew Kim' applies to determining beneficial ownership regardless of legal title. Second, even if beneficial interests were equal (50-50), this does not mean the children get 50% - the survivorship rule means the mother gets 100% of legal title, and if there's a beneficial trust, she might hold part on trust for the estate. The answer is confused about both beneficial interests and survivorship."

The will gives 'the sum standing to my credit in my DBS bank account' - this is a specific gift of whatever money is in the identified account. The ambulatory nature principle (s 19 WA) means the will speaks as of death. At death, $20,000 stands to the testator's credit in the account. Therefore, the son receives $20,000. This is not ademption because the account still exists (it was not closed). The gift is of 'the sum standing to my credit' - not '$100,000 from my account' but 'the sum' (whatever amount) in the account. The amount has decreased due to withdrawals, but the account itself exists and contains $20,000. The son takes the account balance as it exists at death, whether more or less than at execution. If the testator wanted the son to receive a fixed $100,000, the will should give '$100,000' as a general pecuniary legacy, not 'the sum in my account' which varies.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it freezes the gift at execution, contradicting the ambulatory nature of wills. Section 19 WA provides that wills speak as of death, not execution. The will gives 'the sum standing to my credit in my DBS account' - 'the sum standing' is determined at death, not execution. If the account had increased to $200,000 by death (due to interest, deposits, etc.), the son would receive $200,000. Similarly, if it decreased to $20,000 (due to withdrawals), the son receives $20,000. The beneficiary bears the risk of decrease and gets the benefit of increase. This is how specific gifts of variable property (like bank account balances) work. The answer incorrectly fixes the amount at execution.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because ademption requires the property to not exist, not merely to decrease in value or amount. The notes state: 'Ademption: failure of gift of property, because property does not exist at testator's death.' Here, the bank account exists - it was not closed. It has $20,000 in it. The gift is of 'the sum standing to my credit in my DBS account' - the account is there, and the sum standing to credit is $20,000. Ademption would apply if the testator closed the account before death (then there would be no 'sum standing to credit' because the account does not exist). But withdrawal of most funds from an account that remains open is not ademption - the gift is simply of the reduced balance. The answer incorrectly treats reduction in amount as ademption.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the gift is of 'the sum in my account,' not '$100,000 from my estate.' The son's gift is a specific gift of the account balance, not a general pecuniary legacy of $100,000. If the will said '$100,000 to my son,' this would be a general pecuniary legacy that must be paid from estate assets (the executor could use money from the DBS account or any other source). But the will specifically gives 'the sum standing to my credit in my DBS account number 123-456-789' - this identifies the specific account as the source. The son gets whatever is in that account ($20,000), not $100,000 from anywhere in the estate. The answer conflates specific gifts (of identified property) with general legacies (of money from the estate generally)."

      "question": "Testator's will states: 'I give my residuary estate to my trustees on trust for sale for my daughter.' The will does not expressly state a power to postpone sale. The daughter asks the trustees not to sell the property immediately as she wants to live in it. Can the trustees postpone the sale?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Trustees likely have implied power to postpone, exercisable reasonably. While the notes commonly show wills with express 'power to postpone sale' (e.g., 'on trust for sale with power to postpone sale'), the absence of such express power does not necessarily mandate immediate sale. The notes from Foo Jee Seng indicate: 'Although a trustee of a trust for sale was accorded the power to postpone sale as he thought fit, such a power had to still be exercised reasonably.' This refers to express power, but the underlying principle is that trustees must act reasonably in the beneficiaries' interests. A trust for sale means the trustees have a duty to sell, but the timing may have some flexibility. If immediate sale would be disadvantageous (poor market, beneficiary wishes to live in property temporarily, sale costs, etc.), trustees might have implied power to postpone briefly. However, indefinite postponement would breach the trust for sale. The trustees must balance the duty to sell against prudent administration. The daughter's wish to live in the property is a factor, but not controlling. The trustees should consider: market conditions, carrying costs, the daughter's needs, and whether postponement serves the trust's purposes.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This overstates trustees' discretion. While trustees may have some flexibility in timing, 'inherent power' to postpone indefinitely is too strong. A trust for sale creates a duty to sell, not merely a power. Without an express power to postpone, the trustees' discretion is more limited. The notes from Foo Jee Seng discuss express 'power to postpone sale as he thought fit' - when such power exists, trustees have broad discretion (subject to reasonableness). Without express power, the trustees have a duty to sell, though they may have limited implied discretion about timing. If trustees postpone indefinitely or unreasonably without express power, beneficiaries could compel sale. The answer incorrectly suggests unlimited inherent power to postpone.",
          "B": "This is too strict. While a trust for sale creates a duty to sell, 'immediately' is not necessarily required, especially if immediate sale would be imprudent. Trustees have fiduciary duties to act in beneficiaries' interests, which includes choosing appropriate timing for sales. Selling in a market crash or during a downturn would waste estate value. Trustees might postpone briefly to get better prices or to accommodate the beneficiary's reasonable requests (living in the property short-term). However, without express power to postpone, prolonged delay would be problematic. The trustees should sell within a reasonable time, but not necessarily 'immediately.' The answer incorrectly mandates immediate sale without any flexibility.",
          "C": "While beneficiary consent is relevant (if all beneficiaries consent to postponement, this likely protects the trustees from liability for not selling immediately), it is not the only basis for postponement. Trustees might be able to postpone even without consent if postponement is in the beneficiaries' interests (e.g., waiting for better market conditions benefits the daughter by maximizing sale proceeds for her trust fund). The notes from Foo Jee Seng focus on the trustees' duty to exercise discretion reasonably, not on obtaining beneficiary consent. Here, there is only one beneficiary (the daughter), so her consent is strong evidence that postponement is acceptable. But the legal analysis is whether postponement is reasonable and proper exercise of trustee discretion, not just whether the beneficiary consents. The answer makes consent the sole criterion when reasonableness is the standard."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Singapore law applies to immovable property in Singapore. The notes state: 'Law regulating distribution (section 4 ISA): The distribution of the movable property of a person deceased shall be regulated by the law of the country in which he was domiciled at the time of his death (lex domicilii). The distribution of the immovable property of a person deceased shall be regulated by this Act wherever he may have been domiciled at the time of his death (lex situs).' This creates a clear conflict of laws rule: movable property (personal estate) is governed by the law of the domicile at death (lex domicilii), but immovable property (real estate, land) is governed by the law of where the property is situated (lex situs). Here, the testator died domiciled in Malaysia, but owned immovable property in Singapore. For this Singapore immovable property, section 4 ISA provides that 'this Act' (the ISA) applies 'wherever he may have been domiciled' - meaning Singapore's ISA governs distribution regardless of the testator's Malaysian domicile. The Singapore property is distributed according to ISA s 7 rules, not Malaysian intestacy law.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores the lex situs rule for immovable property in s 4 ISA. While Malaysian law would govern the testator's movable property (lex domicilii - law of domicile), it does not govern the Singapore immovable property. Section 4 ISA specifically provides that 'immovable property... shall be regulated by this Act wherever he may have been domiciled at the time of his death.' This is the lex situs principle - land is governed by the law of where it is located. The policy is that each country controls distribution of land within its borders, regardless of the deceased's domicile. This allows Singapore to ensure its land is distributed according to Singapore law and policy. The answer incorrectly applies lex domicilii to immovable property.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because there is no splitting of legal and beneficial ownership between different laws for intestacy purposes. Section 4 ISA provides that 'the distribution' of immovable property is regulated by the ISA - this covers both legal and beneficial ownership. Distribution under ISA determines who becomes the owner (both legally and beneficially) of the property. The answer invents a dual-law system that does not exist. While it is possible in other contexts (trusts, etc.) for legal and beneficial ownership to be split, for intestate distribution under s 4 ISA, Singapore law applies to the entire distribution of Singapore immovable property.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because conflict of laws rules are not based on favorability to beneficiaries but on connecting factors (domicile, situs). Section 4 ISA sets out clear rules: lex domicilii for movables, lex situs for immovables. Courts apply these rules regardless of which law would benefit beneficiaries more. Allowing choice of the more favorable law would create uncertainty, forum shopping, and potential for manipulation. The law must be predictable and based on objective connecting factors. Here, the connecting factor for immovable property is situs (location) - Singapore. Therefore, Singapore law applies. The answer invents a favorability principle that contradicts the conflict of laws framework."

The will states 'I give my entire estate to my children' but then clarifies 'it is my intention that Eric receive nothing further under this will.'

The notes from Foo Jee Seng emphasize: 'the overriding aim of the court in construing a will is to seek and give effect to the testamentary intention as expressed by the testator in the will' (at [17]) and 'effect should be given to every word of the will' (at [17]). Here, the testator expressed clear intention to exclude Eric (having already provided for him through lifetime gifts). The estate is divided among the other children, not including Eric. This is different from precatory language ('I wish Eric to receive less') which would be unenforceable. Here, the language is clear and operative: 'Eric receive nothing further.' The testator exercised testamentary freedom to exclude Eric, which is permissible (subject to any claims Eric might have under Inheritance (Family Provision) Act if he qualifies as a dependent).",
        "incorrect": {
          "B": "This is incorrect because the clause uses clear operative language, not precatory language. Precatory words are wishes or desires that do not create legal obligations (e.g., 'I wish,' 'I hope,' 'I desire'). The notes from Lau Tyng Tyng identify 'wish and strong desire' as precatory language that is unenforceable. Here, the clause states 'I give my entire estate to my children, but... it is my intention that Eric receive nothing further.' 'It is my intention that Eric receive nothing' is a clear expression of dispositive intent, not a mere wish. Combined with the explanation that Eric already received lifetime gifts, the testator's intention to exclude Eric from the will is unambiguous. Effect should be given to this intention. Eric receives nothing. The answer incorrectly treats clear operative exclusion as precatory.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it imposes a condition not in the will. The will does not say 'Eric is excluded if he received lifetime gifts equal in value to his siblings' shares.' It says 'I have already made provision for Eric through lifetime gifts' (a recital of fact) and 'Eric receive nothing further under this will' (a clear direction). The clause operates regardless of whether the lifetime gifts equal the testamentary shares. Perhaps Eric received more or less than his siblings will receive - the testator's judgment was that Eric has been sufficiently provided for, and the testator excludes Eric. Whether this is 'fair' or whether the lifetime gifts match the testamentary shares is irrelevant. The testator has testamentary freedom to exclude Eric. The answer invents a proportionality requirement.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no ambiguity requiring extrinsic evidence. The will states: (1) 'my entire estate to my children,' (2) 'I have already made provision for my eldest son Eric,' (3) 'my intention that Eric receive nothing further.' Reading these clauses together, the meaning is clear: the estate goes to the children other than Eric, who is excluded because he already received lifetime provision. There are not multiple reasonable interpretations requiring extrinsic evidence to choose between. The notes from Low Ah Cheow state extrinsic evidence is admissible 'if the testator's expressed intention is ambiguous on the face of the will.' Here, the intention is not ambiguous - it is clearly to exclude Eric. The answer invents ambiguity where none exists."
