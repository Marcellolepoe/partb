      "options": {
        "A": "A data breach occurs only when personal data is actually accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons.",

        "C": "A data breach occurs only when personal data is lost or stolen.",
        "D": "A data breach occurs only when the breach results in significant harm to individuals."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Under s 26A PDPA, a 'data breach' means: (a) the unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal of personal data, OR (b) the unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal of personal data is likely to occur. The definition includes both actual breaches and situations where breaches are likely to occur. This is broader than s 24 (protection obligation), which is preventative - s 26A applies when threats have materialized or are likely to materialize. The definition does not require actual harm or significant harm - harm is relevant for determining whether a breach is 'notifiable' under s 26B, not for determining whether a breach has occurred.",
        "incorrect": {
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 26A defines a data breach to include both actual unauthorized activity AND situations where such activity is 'likely to occur.' The definition is not limited to actual breaches - it includes potential breaches that are likely to happen. The 'only actual breaches' interpretation ignores the 'likely to occur' language in s 26A.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 26A defines a data breach more broadly than just loss or theft. The definition includes unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal - not just loss or theft. A breach can occur through various means, not limited to physical loss or theft of data.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 26A does NOT require significant harm for a data breach to occur. The definition focuses on unauthorized activity (actual or likely), not on harm. Significant harm is relevant for determining whether a breach is 'notifiable' under s 26B, not for determining whether a breach has occurred. A breach can occur without significant harm."

      "options": {
        "A": "All data breaches are notifiable data breaches under s 26B.",
        "B": "A notifiable data breach is a data breach that results in, or is likely to result in, significant harm to an affected individual, OR is of a significant scale, OR is deemed notifiable in prescribed circumstances.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Under s 26B PDPA, a 'notifiable data breach' is a data breach that: (a) results in, or is likely to result in, significant harm to an affected individual, OR (b) is of a significant scale, OR (c) is deemed to result in significant harm and of significant scale in prescribed circumstances (s 26B(2)-(3)). Significant harm and significant scale are defined in DBN Regulations: significant harm includes breaches affecting prescribed personal data (e.g., NRIC, financial information, health data) or in other prescribed circumstances; significant scale means breaches affecting 500 or more individuals. Importantly, s 26B(4) provides that breaches involving only unauthorized access/use/disclosure within an organization (not external) are deemed NOT notifiable. Not all breaches are notifiable - only those meeting the harm/scale thresholds.",

          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "A": "This is incorrect because NOT all data breaches are notifiable. S 26B defines a notifiable data breach as one that results in or is likely to result in significant harm, is of significant scale, or is deemed notifiable in prescribed circumstances. Many breaches may not meet these thresholds. Additionally, s 26B(4) explicitly excludes breaches involving only unauthorized activity within an organization. The 'all breaches notifiable' interpretation contradicts s 26B's threshold requirements.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 26B does NOT require actual financial loss. The provision requires 'significant harm' which is broader than financial loss - it includes harm to reputation, emotional distress, identity theft, etc. Additionally, breaches of significant scale (500+ individuals) are notifiable even without significant harm. The 'only financial loss' interpretation is too narrow.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 26B does NOT require 1000+ individuals. The provision defines 'significant scale' as affecting 500 or more individuals (per DBN Regulations Reg 4). Additionally, breaches resulting in significant harm are notifiable regardless of scale. The '1000+ individuals' threshold is incorrect."

The data controller, not the intermediary, is responsible for: (1) assessing whether the breach is notifiable under s 26C(2), and (2) notifying PDPC under s 26D if it is notifiable. The intermediary's obligation is limited to notifying the controller promptly - it does not notify PDPC or affected individuals directly. This recognizes that controllers are responsible for compliance and decision-making, while intermediaries must alert controllers to breaches they discover.",

The controller is responsible for assessing whether the breach is notifiable and notifying PDPC if required. Intermediaries notify controllers; controllers notify PDPC. The 'notify PDPC directly' interpretation ignores the intermediary's obligation to notify the controller.",

        "correct": "Under s 26D(1) PDPA, where an organization assesses that a data breach is notifiable, it must notify PDPC as soon as practicable and, in any case, within 3 calendar days. The 3-calendar-day deadline runs from when the organization assesses that the breach is notifiable (not from when the breach occurred or was discovered). The 'as soon as practicable' requirement means organizations should notify promptly, but the absolute deadline is 3 calendar days. The notification must contain prescribed information (per s 26D(3) and DBN Regulations Reg 5), including details about the breach, affected individuals, potential harm, and remedial actions.",
        "incorrect": {
          "B": "This is the correct answer.",
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 26D(1) requires notification 'as soon as practicable and, in any case, within 3 calendar days' - not immediately. The provision recognizes that organizations need time to assess breaches and gather information. 'Immediately' would be impractical and may result in incomplete notifications. The 3-calendar-day deadline provides a reasonable timeframe while ensuring prompt notification.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 26D(1) requires notification within 3 calendar days, not 30 days. The 3-day deadline ensures prompt notification to PDPC, allowing for timely oversight and potential intervention. The '30 days' interpretation contradicts the clear 3-calendar-day requirement.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 26D(1) requires proactive notification - organizations must notify PDPC when they assess a breach is notifiable, not wait for PDPC to request notification. The obligation is triggered by the organization's assessment, not by PDPC's request. Waiting for a request would delay notification and undermine the purpose of breach notification."

The notification must be made in any manner that is reasonable in the circumstances (e.g., email, letter, public notice). The notification must contain prescribed information per s 26D(3) and DBN Regulations Reg 6, including circumstances of the breach, affected personal data, potential harm, remedial actions, and steps individuals can take.

The provision requires PDPC notification first, then individual notification. Additionally, notification is only required if the breach results in significant harm - not all notifiable breaches require individual notification.",

S 26D(2) requires individual notification if breach is notifiable AND results in significant harm. Notifying PDPC does not satisfy the individual notification requirement - both obligations apply. The 'only PDPC notification' interpretation ignores s 26D(2).",

The provisions do not create a choice - both notifications are required when the conditions are met. The 'choose between' interpretation is incorrect.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 26D(2) creates a mandatory obligation to notify affected individuals if the breach is notifiable AND results in significant harm - it does not require PDPC direction. PDPC direction is relevant for exemption under s 26D(6), not for the obligation itself. The 'only if PDPC directs' interpretation is incorrect."
