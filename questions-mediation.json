An interest may not be obvious. A position is a demand made by a party - it is merely one way to satisfy a perceived interest. The key is to focus on interests, not positions, and dig under positions for interests by asking 'why' or 'why not'. **Statement II (INCORRECT):** This is reversed. Options are bilateral - they involve the other party. Alternatives are unilateral - what one can do without cooperation of the other party (BATNA, WATNA, MLATNA). **Statement III (CORRECT):** BATNA is the Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. If an offer is less than or equal to BATNA (or WATNA), parties should walk away since the best alternative is better than the offer. If an offer is greater than or equal to BATNA, parties should be open to agreement. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Objective criteria (also known as legitimacy) can be used as both a sword (to persuade someone that an option is fair) and a shield (to protect against an option that is not fair). This leads to face-saving and justifiable results. **Statement V (CORRECT):** Under the 7 Elements framework, commitments should be made only at the end of the process when: parties' interests are understood and prioritised; options that satisfy interests are generated; options are evaluated according to objective criteria or fair procedure; and alternatives are considered.",

Relationship issues can stand in the way of settlement of substantive issues (e.g. in divorce cases, parties often forget about what is the best interest of their child and often use their children as proxies). Parties should 'separate people (emotional part) from problem' and focus on 'parties to get what they want, not about getting even'. This is a reminder to look at the issues objectively and not be influenced (negatively) by how you feel about the person. **Statement III (CORRECT):** At the minimum, parties must have a 'working relationship' to jointly solve the dispute, so they are more willing to communicate and be collaborative with more solutions. This relationship should be built at the earliest opportunity, and can even begin before mediation proper. Parties should be unconditionally constructive in building a good relationship. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** To improve relationships, parties should consider: perception (put yourself in the other's shoes to appreciate a different perspective), emotion (allow venting), and communication (build rapport through verbal/non-verbal communication). **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Even if parties never had a good relationship, mediation can still be suitable.

This includes: early stage of dispute (before commencement of adversarial process); after litigation/arbitration proceedings have commenced; while the matter is on appeal; and even after judgment has been delivered, in relation to appeal or enforcement (e.g. payment in instalment of court-ordered judgement). **Statement III (CORRECT):** Who should attend mediation includes: the parties themselves; a person with authority to settle (someone who can sign the settlement agreement at the end of the session); based on party's temperament (sometimes having too many people in the room can cause tempers to flare, so have generally level headed people come); and anyone who may affect mediation outcome. **Statement IV (INCORRECT):** For companies, someone who can enter contracts for the company must attend. For individuals, the person themselves is usually enough, BUT note that even individuals can have others who have influence over them (e.g. family or friends) who they would like to seek approval from before settling.

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** The introduction stage involves the mediator building rapport with clients and their counsels. The mediator makes an opening statement explaining the process. **Statement II (CORRECT):** During the opening statement stage, Party A gives an oral opening statement, the mediator summarizes Party A's statement, then Party B gives an opening statement, and the mediator summarizes Party B's statement. Note that there is also a written document called an opening statement that is submitted before mediation starts. **Statement III (CORRECT):** During the problem solving stage, the parties set an agenda, explore issues, engage in private sessions (where everyone is in the same room initially, then private sessions afford parties a chance to talk to the mediator without the other party present), and participate in joint negotiation sessions. There can be several rounds of joint and private sessions. Finally, if successful, parties reach an agreement. **Statement IV (INCORRECT):** During agenda setting, parties are NOT restricted to any previous pleadings, etc. and do NOT frame issues to be discussed from a legal POV. Mediation is about problem-solving, not legal rights. **Statement V (CORRECT):** Private sessions afford the parties a chance to talk to the mediator without the other party present. This is good in situations where there is still a lack of trust in the other side. Whatever is said in these sessions is private unless the party agrees that it can be shared.",

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** Mediators can often get the party to open up and engage meaningfully in the process, even if the party initially attends only because of contractual obligation. A skilled mediator can help parties see the benefits of settlement. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Even if a settlement is not reached, at least the parties can get a better appreciation for each other's cases. This understanding may help in subsequent proceedings or may even lead to settlement later. **Statement III (CORRECT):** As counsel, the lawyer's role is to advise on the benefits of mediation and the risks of going to trial. The lawyer should help the client understand why settlement may be preferable, including considerations of cost, time, risk, and other factors. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** If the party is there on a fishing expedition to try and fish for the other party's trial strategy or whatever, a good mediator would call the mediation to a halt. Mediation requires good faith participation, and using it as a fishing expedition is not appropriate. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** The lawyer should NOT encourage the client to use mediation as an opportunity to gather information if the client has no intention of settling. This would be a fishing expedition, which is not a legitimate use of mediation. Parties must participate in good faith under PCR Rule 8A(3).",

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** Under Heartronics Corporation v EPI Life Pte Ltd and others [2017] SGHCR 17 at [71], the Court held that multi-tiered dispute resolution clauses were regarded as a unitary dispute resolution mechanism. The defendant's repudiatory breaches of the mediation portion of the ADR clauses had rendered the arbitration portion of the clauses inoperative. **Statement II (CORRECT):** If a party breaches the mediation requirement by commencing arbitration without attempting mediation, the other party may be able to resist the arbitration. In Heartronics, the defendant was unable to rely on the arbitration agreement because of the repudiatory breach of the mediation portion, and the Court dismissed the defendant's application to stay court proceedings. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Multi-tiered clauses have advantages including: ADR can save time and costs if you can solve the dispute before it gets to the later stage of arbitration; and parties tend to be quite reluctant to broach mediation because if they do, it looks like they don't really believe in their case - an agreement upfront to go for mediation prevents this perceived show of weakness. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** A disadvantage of multi-tiered clauses is that if you want to mediate, you don't need to agree to do it in writing. But bear in mind the earlier point of having a requirement for mediation in the contract - it prevents reluctance to propose mediation. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Multi-tiered clauses are NOT always unenforceable. As shown in Heartronics, they can be enforced, and breaches of the mediation requirement can affect the enforceability of the arbitration portion. Courts will enforce them, but may find that breaches of the mediation requirement render the arbitration portion inoperative.",

Premature mediation may be pointless because the defendant doesn't know the particulars of the case it has to answer. Mediation may also be too late (after full particulars and documents have been exchanged) because costs have already been incurred to get to that point. 'The trick in many cases is to identify the happy medium: the point when the detail of the claim and the response are known to both sides, but before the costs that have been incurred in reaching that stage are so great that a settlement is no longer possible.' **Statement III (CORRECT):** Silence in the face of an invitation to participate in ADR is, as a general rule, of itself unreasonable - PGF II SA v OMFS Co 1 Ltd [2014] 1 WLR 1386. Even if an outright refusal, or a refusal to engage in the type of ADR requested, or to do so at the time requested, might have been justified by the identification of reasonable grounds, silence itself is unreasonable. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** The cost of mediation work is claimable, the costs of mediation work could also have been taken into account by the court when awarding party-and-party costs - Legis Point LLC v Tay Choon Ai [2018] 3 SLR 1269 at [94]. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** A party cannot always refuse ADR without consequences. Courts can penalize parties for unreasonably refusing ADR through costs orders. Under ROC 2021 O21 r2(2)(a), the court must have regard to efforts made at amicable resolution when fixing costs.

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** An interest is a motivation behind a demand made by a party to a dispute. It represents the needs and concerns of the party. A position is a demand made by a party. It is merely one way to satisfy a perceived interest or set of interests. For example, Position: 'I want my neighbour to stop playing his piano' vs Interest: 'I need my rest as I'm working the early shift'. **Statement II (CORRECT):** An interest may not be obvious and parties may not even be aware of their interests. Thus, a mediator must assist to surface such parties' interests - ask why or why not? The mediator helps parties discover their true motivations. **Statement III (CORRECT):** The key to mediation is understanding the parties' interests and finding common interests of parties (cf conflicting interest). Focus on interests, not positions. Clarify and prioritise party's interests - ask questions to 'test' and clarify interests and concerns raised by the other party. Interests must be understood before a dispute can be effectively resolved. Dig under positions for interests - ask 'why', 'why not'. Capitalise on joint interests (joint problem solving). Help parties realise that to resolve a dispute, the other party's interest(s) will have to be addressed. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Examples of interests include: Goodwill, Reputation, Relationships, Security, Business Opportunities, Recognition. These are the underlying motivations behind positions. Understanding these helps find solutions that satisfy both parties' interests. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Positions are NOT more important than interests. The opposite is true - mediators should focus on interests, not positions. Focusing on positions leads to positional bargaining and deadlock. Focusing on interests allows parties to find creative solutions that satisfy both parties' underlying needs.",

Using alternatives to reality check your client - is going to court instead something acceptable to the client? Need to account for costs of going to court, chance of gaining something more or less, etc. Purpose - Evaluation of whether or not to accept option(s). Options are 'bilateral' - involves the other party. Alternatives are 'unilateral' - what one can do without cooperation of the other party. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Types of alternatives possible: BATNA - Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement; WATNA - Worst Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement; MLATNA - Most Likely Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. These help parties understand their options if mediation fails. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Evaluating alternatives: Reality testing - Is one's BATNA realistic? E.g. if a party says that he is 'sure to win in court', raise questions to help parties realise that that view may not be realistic. Estimate the other party's BATNA. To have a better appreciation of the strength of the other's bargaining power. Understanding both parties' alternatives helps evaluate offers. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** If offer less than or equal to WATNA, BATNA, then likely no agreement and parties should walk away (since best alternative to negotiated agreement is BETTER than the offer on the table). If offer greater than or equal to BATNA, parties should be open to an agreement and commit to it. This helps parties make informed decisions. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Alternatives ARE important in mediation. They help parties evaluate whether to accept offers. Parties should NOT always accept any offer - they should compare offers to their alternatives. If an offer is worse than their BATNA, they should walk away.

      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** Under Rule 8A PCR - Conduct of alternative dispute resolution process: (1) A legal practitioner must always be respectful of the alternative dispute resolution process and the adjudicator, mediator or other person conducting the process. (2) A legal practitioner must always be courteous in the conduct or presentation of his or her client's case in an alternative dispute resolution process. Respect and courtesy are required. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Under Rule 8A(3) PCR, a legal practitioner must act in good faith throughout the alternative dispute resolution process. (4) A legal practitioner must not knowingly mislead or attempt to mislead in any way an adjudicator, a mediator or other person conducting the alternative dispute resolution process. (5) A legal practitioner must not knowingly assist or permit his or her client to mislead an adjudicator, a mediator or other person conducting the alternative dispute resolution process. Honesty is mandatory. **Statement III (CORRECT):** While a Mediation Advocate may adopt any negotiation strategy that is in the best interest of his/her client: do not resort to underhanded negotiation tactics; do not mislead the other party or his/her lawyer with false information; endeavour to keep the negotiation constructive and collaborative with a view to resolving the dispute in a manner that is mutually acceptable by the parties. Strategy must be ethical. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** The duty to act in good faith and be honest applies throughout the mediation process, including in negotiations with the other party. Even though the lawyer must protect and advance the client's interests robustly, this must be done within the bounds of honesty and good faith. The lawyer can be zealous but not dishonest. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Lawyers CANNOT use any tactics they want, including lying and misleading. Under Rule 8A PCR, lawyers must act in good faith, must not mislead, and must not assist clients to mislead. Lying and misleading are prohibited and can result in professional discipline. While lawyers can be strategic and zealous, they must remain honest and act in good faith.",

Check whether client wants outcome that the court / law cannot grant (e.g. just an apology). Cost of litigation relative to claim (e.g. if claim is only for a few thousand dollars). Timing of mediation. Relationship between parties. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Confidentiality - if it is important not to air dirty linen in public, then should opt for mediation. Relationship between parties: Are the clients in the right frame of mind to come up with an agreement and settlement? Wait for them to cool down first. Must be working relationship at the minimum. Sometimes parties have had a good relationship before it started to break down, so mediation might be the place for relationships to be repaired. **Statement III (CORRECT):** EXCEPTION WHERE CASE IS NOT SUITABLE FOR MEDIATION: If you need a precedent from the court. If you need some power of the court (e.g. injunction). These are situations where court powers are necessary. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Lecturer - the question should be 'why not mediation?' This reflects the general presumption that mediation should be considered for most disputes, and parties should have good reasons for not using it. Mediation should be the default consideration. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Mediation IS suitable for many cases. The general principle is that any civil case is suitable for mediation, and the question should be 'why not mediation?' Litigation is not always better - mediation can provide faster, cheaper, more flexible solutions.

This is good in situations where there is still a lack of trust in the other side. Whatever is said in these sessions is private unless the party agrees that it can be shared. Private sessions allow for candid discussions. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** There can be several rounds of joint and private sessions.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": {
      "correct": "**Statement I (CORRECT):** PRACTICAL THINGS FOR LAWYER TO DO DURING MEDIATION: Don't focus on legal rights and obligations. Mediation is about problem solving, not determining legal rights. Lawyers should guide discussions toward interests and solutions rather than engaging in legal arguments. The focus should be on finding solutions that meet both parties' interests. **Statement II (CORRECT):** Allow parties to articulate their positions and feelings. Guide client to make their point and ensure that they maintain a neutral tone. Guide client to focus on the proceedings and not get distracted with phone or stuff. Parties need to express themselves, and lawyers should facilitate this while keeping things constructive. **Statement III (CORRECT):** Don't make things worse by demanding things that your client is not interested in. Don't ask for a better deal when the client is ready to settle for something. That said, advise your client properly if you think he is settling for something without having a full appraisal of the situation and his alternatives. Lawyers should respect client decisions while ensuring they are informed. **Statement IV (CORRECT):** Consider impact of caselaw (and legal rights) on alternatives and reality checking - but better for caselaw to be brought up during a private caucus rather than in an open session (if not the other side might pick up on it to be used as a negotiation tool and become entrenched). Legal information can be useful for reality checking, but should be used strategically. **Statement V (INCORRECT):** Lawyers should NOT focus exclusively on legal rights and make extensive legal arguments. This is counterproductive in mediation. Mediation is about problem solving, not legal arguments. Extensive legal arguments can make parties more entrenched in their positions and reduce the chances of settlement. The focus should be on interests, options, and solutions.",
