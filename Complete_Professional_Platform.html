Statement III (pro forma financials) is not typically required unless specifically agreed. Statement IV (director confirmation) sounds reasonable but is not a standard requirement - the facility agreement and corporate authority (board resolutions) already establish the company's authority to borrow.",

II) MAC clauses protect lenders from material adverse changes affecting the borrower's ability to perform obligations. V) EOD confirmations ensure the borrower remains in compliance. III) Pro forma financials are not standard CPs - lenders rely on original financials and ongoing covenants.

Statement V is incorrect - lenders voting for waivers could potentially face liability if they acted negligently or in bad faith. The key liability issues are: wrongful acceleration (II), misrepresentation-based voting (III), and agent notification failures (IV).",

III) Lenders voting based on misrepresentations may be liable to other lenders for resulting losses. IV) Facility agents must properly notify all lenders and follow procedures - failure creates liability exposure. I) Facility agents typically have broad protection clauses and discretion.

Statement III is incorrect - pledges don't require the same assets to remain pledged. Statement V is incorrect - only land charges require SLA registration; company charges require ACRA registration.",
                "detailed_explanation": "Security Validity in Liquidation: II) Floating charges created within 6 months of liquidation may be invalid unless new value was given after creation (Companies Act s329). IV) Floating charges crystallize into fixed charges upon appointment of receiver or other crystallization events. I) Fixed charges are not subject to the 6-month clawback rule that applies to floating charges. III) Pledges don't require the same specific assets - the pledge interest attaches to the class of inventory.

Statement II is incorrect - 60% of S$75 million is S$45 million, and current drawings are S$55 million, so the threshold is exceeded, but the utilization fee calculation method matters. Statement IV is incorrect - commitment fees are typically calculated on a daily basis, not monthly.",
                "detailed_explanation": "Facility Cost Calculations: I) Commitment fees are calculated on average daily undrawn balances over the period. III) Interest uses weighted average drawn amounts to reflect timing of drawdowns/repayments. V) Utilization fees are typically calculated only on the excess amount above the threshold, not the entire drawn amount. II) The threshold calculation is correct (60% of S$75m = S$45m), but the fee calculation method determines whether it applies to excess or total.

V) Liquidation preferences can be non-participating (fixed amount) or participating (fixed amount plus pro rata share of remaining proceeds), often expressed as multiples (1x, 2x) of original investment.
