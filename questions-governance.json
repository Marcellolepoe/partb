This ensures all investors have equal access to important information.\n\n**What this question tests:** Your understanding of SGX disclosure obligations, particularly for management changes and the procedures for making announcements.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n**I. Management Change Disclosure (CORRECT):**\n- **LR 704** requires immediate announcement of appointments/cessations of key persons including CEO\n- CEO arrest constitutes 'cessation' of the CEO's ability to perform duties\n- This is material information that would affect share price\n- Must be announced immediately, not when convenient\n\n**III. Trading Halt Requirement (CORRECT):**\n- **LR 703(4)** requires trading halt when material information is disclosed during trading hours\n- Ensures proper dissemination of information to all market participants\n- Prevents selective disclosure and insider trading\n- Trading resumes after announcement is made\n\n**Why other statements are wrong:**\n\n**II. Price Impact Irrelevant (INCORRECT):**\n- Disclosure obligation exists regardless of whether price has already moved\n- Market rumors don't eliminate the company's disclosure duty\n- **LR 703(1)** requires disclosure if information materially affects price\n- Company must make official announcement even if market already knows\n\n**IV. SGXNET Mandatory (INCORRECT):**\n- **LR 702** mandates SGXNET for all announcements\n- Other media can be used simultaneously but not instead of SGXNET\n- SGXNET ensures proper dissemination to all market participants\n- Press releases alone don't satisfy listing rule requirements\n\n**V. Personal Misconduct Must Be Disclosed (INCORRECT):**\n- Management changes must be disclosed under **LR 704** regardless of nature\n- CEO arrest affects company's management and operations\n- Personal misconduct of key personnel is material information\n- Company must disclose any change in key personnel\n\n**Exam Tips:**\n- Management changes = immediate disclosure required\n- Trading halt needed for material announcements during trading hours\n- SGXNET is mandatory for all announcements\n- Personal nature doesn't eliminate disclosure obligation",
