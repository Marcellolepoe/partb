    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "I is correct - Alpha Bank is a creditor under s 124(1)(c) IRDA and has locus standi. II is correct - the statutory demand procedure under s 125(2)(a) creates a deemed inability to pay debts. III is wrong - the court has discretion under s 128 IRDA and can refuse the order for public policy reasons. IV is wrong - the statutory demand creates a deemed inability, actual insolvency proof is not required.",
    "detailed_explanation": "**BASIC CONCEPT: Compulsory Winding Up (CWU) - Three-Stage Legal Framework**\n\nCompulsory winding up is a court-ordered process to liquidate a company. The law requires three things: (1) someone with standing to apply, (2) a valid ground for winding up, and (3) court discretion to make the order.\n\n**What this question tests:** Your understanding of the three-stage framework for compulsory winding up applications and the statutory demand procedure.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n**I. Locus Standi - Creditor Status (CORRECT):**\n- **s 124(1)(c) IRDA** gives creditors the right to apply for winding up\n- Alpha Bank is clearly a creditor (owed S$25,000)\n- This satisfies the 'standing' requirement\n- Without locus standi, the application would be dismissed\n\n**II. Statutory Ground - Deemed Inability to Pay (CORRECT):**\n- **s 125(2)(a) IRDA** creates a 'deemed inability to pay debts'\n- Requirements: (1) debt > S$15,000, (2) written demand served, (3) 3 weeks non-compliance\n- All requirements met: S$25,000 > S$15,000, demand served, 4 weeks non-compliance\n- This creates a statutory ground for winding up\n\n**Why other statements are wrong:**\n\n**III. Court Must Grant Order (INCORRECT):**\n- **s 128 IRDA** gives the court discretion to refuse winding up\n- Court can refuse for public policy reasons (BNP Paribas case)\n- Even if all requirements are met, court doesn't have to grant the order\n- Court considers factors like public interest, alternative remedies\n\n**IV. Must Prove Actual Insolvency (INCORRECT):**\n- Statutory demand creates a 'deemed' inability to pay\n- No need to prove actual insolvency under cash flow test\n- The 3-week non-compliance is enough\n- This is the whole point of the statutory demand procedure\n\n**Exam Tips:**\n- Remember the three-stage framework: locus standi → statutory grounds → court discretion\n- Statutory demand creates 'deemed' inability, not actual insolvency\n- Court has discretion even when all requirements are met\n- Look for the S$15,000 threshold and 3-week period",

    "detailed_explanation": "**BASIC CONCEPT: Execution Returned Unsatisfied as Ground for Winding Up**\n\nWhen a creditor gets a judgment but can't collect the money (execution returned unsatisfied), this can be grounds for winding up the debtor company.\n\n**What this question tests:** Your understanding of the execution returned unsatisfied procedure and the three-stage winding up framework.\n\n**Key Legal Principles:**\n\n**I. Locus Standi - Creditor Status (CORRECT):**\n- **s 124(1)(c) IRDA** gives creditors the right to apply for winding up\n- SupplierCo is a creditor (owed S$30,000 judgment debt)\n- This satisfies the standing requirement\n- Creditors have automatic standing to apply\n\n**II. Statutory Ground - Execution Returned Unsatisfied (CORRECT):**\n- **s 125(2)(b) IRDA** makes execution returned unsatisfied a ground for winding up\n- Requirements: (1) judgment debt, (2) writ of execution issued, (3) execution returned unsatisfied\n- All requirements met: S$30,000 judgment, writ issued, returned unsatisfied\n- This creates a statutory ground for winding up\n\n**III. Court Discretion Required (CORRECT):**\n- **s 128 IRDA** requires court to exercise discretion before making winding up order\n- Court considers factors like public interest, alternative remedies\n- Even with valid grounds, court can refuse the order\n- This is the third stage of the winding up framework\n\n**Why Statement IV is wrong:**\n\n**IV. Commencement Date (INCORRECT):**\n- **s 126 IRDA** determines when winding up commences\n- If voluntary winding up (VWU) resolution passed earlier, CWU commences from VWU date\n- If no VWU resolution, CWU commences from application filing date\n- Commencement depends on whether VWU happened first\n\n**Exam Tips:**\n- Execution returned unsatisfied = statutory ground for winding up\n- Remember the three-stage framework: locus standi → statutory grounds → court discretion\n- Commencement date depends on whether VWU resolution was passed earlier\n- Court always has discretion to refuse winding up orders",
