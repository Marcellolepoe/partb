      "question": "Deceased dies intestate survived by his wife and three children. The estate is valued at $1 million. Under section 7 ISA Rule 2, how should the estate be distributed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Wife receives $500,000; each child receives $166,667.",
        "B": "Wife receives $250,000; each child receives $250,000.",
        "C": "Wife receives $333,333; each child receives $222,222.",
        "D": "All four beneficiaries receive $250,000 equally."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The wife receives 50% and the children share the remaining 50% equally. The notes state: 'Rule 2: If an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse and issue, the spouse shall be entitled to one-half of the estate' and 'Rule 3: Subject to the rights of the surviving spouse, if any, the estate... shall be distributed by equal portions per stirpes to and amongst the children of the person dying intestate.' Here, the deceased left a surviving spouse (wife) and issue (three children). Under Rule 2, the spouse gets one-half ($500,000). The remaining half ($500,000) is distributed under Rule 3 to the three children in equal portions: $500,000 ÷ 3 = $166,666.67 each. Total distribution: wife $500K, each child approximately $166,667. The rules create a split between the surviving spouse (50%) and the children as a group (50% divided among them). This balances providing for the spouse and the children.",
        "incorrect": {
          "B": "This is incorrect because it treats all four beneficiaries (spouse and three children) as equal shareholders, which is not what ISA Rules 2 and 3 provide. While this would give $1M ÷ 4 = $250K each, ISA specifically gives the spouse 50% (not 25%) and the children collectively 50% (not 75%). The ISA scheme privileges the spouse by giving them a larger individual share (50%) compared to each child's share (one-third of 50% = 16.67%). If equal division among all four were intended, the statute would say 'spouse and issue share equally.' Instead, Rules 2 and 3 create a two-tier division: spouse gets half, issue share the other half. The answer incorrectly equalizes all beneficiaries.",
          "C": "This appears to use some formula like spouse gets one-third ($333K) and each child gets 22.22% ($222K), but this has no basis in ISA. The notes clearly state Rule 2: 'spouse shall be entitled to one-half of the estate' - not one-third. There is no rule giving spouses one-third when there are three children. The ISA rules are fixed: spouse gets 50% (Rule 2), issue get the other 50% divided equally among them (Rule 3). The answer invents a sliding scale based on number of children that does not exist in the statute.",
          "D": "This treats all four beneficiaries equally ($1M ÷ 4 = $250K each), which is incorrect for the same reasons as answer B. ISA does not provide for equal distribution among spouse and children. The spouse has a privileged position receiving 50% (half the estate) while the children as a group receive the other 50% (divided among them). With three children, each child gets $166,667 (one-third of the children's collective 50%), which is less than the spouse's $500,000. The answer incorrectly equalizes the spouse and children."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The spouse and mother each receive 50%. The notes state: 'Rule 4: If an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse and no issue but a parent or parents, the spouse shall be entitled to one-half of the estate and the parent or parents to the other half of the estate.' Here, the deceased left a surviving spouse and a parent (mother; father predeceased). Under Rule 4, the spouse gets one-half ($400,000) and the parent(s) get one-half ($400,000). Since only one parent survives (mother), she receives the entire parents' share of $400,000. If both parents had survived, they would share the $400,000 equally ($200,000 each per Rule 5's indication that parents take 'in equal portions if there be two parents'). But with only the mother surviving, she gets the full $400,000 parent allocation. Total: spouse $400K, mother $400K.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because ISA Rule 4 specifically provides for parents to receive when there is a spouse but no issue. While the spouse does take priority over more distant relatives (siblings, grandparents, etc.), parents are in a special category under Rule 4. If there were no parents, the spouse would receive 100% under Rule 1 ('If an intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse, no issue and no parent, the spouse shall be entitled to the whole of the estate'). But here, the mother (a parent) survives. Rule 4 applies, splitting the estate 50-50 between spouse and parent(s). The answer incorrectly applies Rule 1 (spouse gets all) when Rule 4 should apply.",
          "C": "This appears to use a 75-25 split ($600K spouse, $200K mother), which has no basis in ISA. The notes state Rule 4 provides a 50-50 split: 'spouse shall be entitled to one-half... and the parent or parents to the other half.' There is no 75-25 rule. Perhaps the answer confused this with some other jurisdiction's rules or invented a weighted formula. ISA is clear: when there is a spouse and parent(s) but no issue, the spouse gets 50% and the parent(s) get 50%. The answer invents a different split ratio.",
          "D": "This appears to give the mother two-thirds ($533K) and the spouse one-third ($267K), which inverts the priority. Under ISA, the spouse always receives at least 50% when present (Rules 2, 4). The spouse never receives less than 50%. Parents receive 50% when there is a spouse but no issue (Rule 4), or 100% when there is no spouse or issue (Rule 5). The answer not only gets the ratio wrong but also suggests parents take more than the spouse, which contradicts the ISA scheme that prioritizes spouses. The answer is completely incorrect."

The deceased is survived by: (1) one whole-blood brother, (2) two half-blood sisters (same mother, different father), and (3) two children of a predeceased whole-blood sister.

      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Whole-blood siblings and their issue take first, then half-blood siblings. Section 6(b) ISA provides: 'those related to a person deceased by the half-blood shall rank immediately after those of the whole blood related to him in the same degree.' The notes from Re Fenton explain: 'Whole-blood sibling's children v Half-blood siblings: Based on S.6(b), the victor is the whole blood sibling (who had actually predeceased the deceased, and the claims were brought by the children of the deceased whole-blood sibling).' This establishes that whole-blood siblings' issue (children) take priority over half-blood siblings. Here, under Rule 6: 'the brothers and sisters and children of deceased brothers or sisters shall share the estate in equal portions between the brothers and sisters and the children of any deceased brother or sister shall take according to their stocks the share which he or she would have taken.' There is one whole-blood brother and one predeceased whole-blood sister (whose children take per stirpes). These whole-blood siblings and their issue constitute one category. The two half-blood sisters are a separate category ranking after. Under Re Fenton and s 6(b), the whole-blood category takes first. The whole-blood brother and the predeceased whole-blood sister's branch each take 50% (the sister's 50% going to her children per stirpes). The half-blood sisters receive nothing because the whole-blood category exhausts the estate.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This incorrectly gives half-blood sisters 50% when whole-blood siblings exist. Section 6(b) provides that half-blood 'rank immediately after those of the whole blood' - meaning whole-blood siblings take first, and half-blood siblings take only if there are no whole-blood siblings or their issue. Here, there is a whole-blood brother and children of a whole-blood sister (taking per stirpes). These whole-blood category beneficiaries exhaust the estate. The notes from Re Fenton confirm: whole-blood siblings' children defeated half-blood siblings. The half-blood sisters receive nothing. The answer incorrectly gives them 50% despite whole-blood siblings existing.",
          "C": "This treats all siblings (whole-blood and half-blood) equally, dividing into three shares. This contradicts s 6(b) which prioritizes whole-blood over half-blood. The notes from Re Fenton are clear: whole-blood siblings and their issue take in priority to half-blood siblings. It is not equal division among all sibling branches - it is whole-blood first, half-blood only if no whole-blood. Here, whole-blood brother and predeceased whole-blood sister's children (per stirpes) take the entire estate. Half-blood sisters receive nothing. The answer incorrectly equalizes whole-blood and half-blood siblings.",
          "D": "This gives half-blood sisters 25%, which is incorrect for the same reason as answers A and C - half-blood siblings do not receive when whole-blood siblings or their issue exist. Section 6(b) creates a clear hierarchy: whole-blood first, then half-blood. The whole-blood category (brother + predeceased sister's children) takes 100% of the estate. Half-blood sisters get nothing. The answer incorrectly allocates 25% to half-blood sisters despite whole-blood beneficiaries existing."

      "question": "Deceased dies intestate with no spouse, descendants, parents, or siblings. The deceased is survived by: (1) one whole-blood aunt (mother's sister, same mother and father), and (2) two half-blood aunts (father's sisters from a different mother). Under ISA section 6 and Chng Heng Tee, how is the estate distributed?",

        "A": "All three aunts share the estate equally.",

        "D": "The estate cannot be distributed and goes to the Government as bona vacantia."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The whole-blood aunt receives the entire estate. In Chng Heng Tee v Estate & Trust Agencies (1927) Ltd [2010] 1 SLR 681, the court addressed competing aunts: 'whole blood aunt from the intestate's mother's blood relations v half blood aunts from the intestate's father's blood relations.' The notes explain: 'Both sections 6(a) and (b) apply; but based on 6(a), it was a draw between the parties. Based on 6(b), the whole blood aunt won' and 'The aunt of the deceased who shared the same parents as the deceased's mother was the sole beneficiary of the deceased's estate to the exclusion of the plaintiffs as she was a whole blood aunt of the deceased, unlike the plaintiffs who were the half blood aunts and half blood uncle of the deceased.' The analysis involves two steps: (1) Section 6(a) provides no distinction between maternal and paternal relatives - both aunts (mother's sister and father's sisters) are uncles/aunts who qualify under Rule 8. (2) Section 6(b) provides half-blood ranks after whole-blood in the same degree. The whole-blood aunt is related by whole blood to the deceased's mother (shares both parents with the mother). The half-blood aunts are related by half-blood to the deceased's father. Under s 6(b), whole-blood takes priority. The whole-blood aunt receives 100%.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores the whole-blood vs half-blood priority in s 6(b). While s 6(a) provides no distinction between maternal and paternal relations (avoiding the common law rule that favored paternal relations), s 6(b) clearly distinguishes whole-blood from half-blood. The notes from Chng Heng Tee show that when there are competing aunts/uncles, s 6(b) determines the outcome: whole-blood aunts/uncles take priority over half-blood. Equal division would only occur if all aunts were of the same blood status (all whole-blood or all half-blood). Here, one is whole-blood and two are half-blood, so the whole-blood aunt takes all. The answer incorrectly equalizes whole-blood and half-blood relatives.",
          "C": "This creates a 50-50 split between whole-blood and half-blood categories, which is not what s 6(b) provides. Section 6(b) does not allocate 50% to whole-blood and 50% to half-blood - it gives whole-blood priority with half-blood taking only if there are no whole-blood relatives in the same degree. The notes state: 'half blood shall rank immediately after those of the whole blood' - 'immediately after' means they are next in line, not that they share simultaneously. Here, because a whole-blood aunt exists, she takes the entire estate. Half-blood aunts are next in line but receive nothing because the estate is exhausted by the whole-blood category. The answer incorrectly splits between categories rather than giving whole-blood priority.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there are qualifying beneficiaries under ISA Rule 8. Rule 8 provides: 'If there are no surviving spouse, descendants, parents, brothers and sisters or children of such brothers and sisters but uncles and aunts of the intestate the uncles and aunts shall take the whole of the estate in equal portions.' The deceased has aunts (whole-blood and half-blood). Under Rule 8, aunts qualify. The whole-blood aunt takes under the priority rule in s 6(b). The estate does not go to the Government. Bona vacantia (Rule 9 - estate to Government) only applies when there are absolutely no relatives qualifying under Rules 1-8. Here, there are aunts under Rule 8. The answer incorrectly concludes bona vacantia when beneficiaries exist."

        "A": "Adam receives 100% as the only surviving child; grandchildren receive nothing.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Adam receives 50% and Betty's children share 50% per stirpes. ISA Rule 3 provides: 'the estate... shall be distributed by equal portions per stirpes to and amongst the children of the person dying intestate and such persons as legally represent those children, in case any of those children be then dead.' The notes explain: 'Proviso No. (1): The persons who legally represent the children of an intestate are their descendants and not their next-of-kin' and 'Proviso No. (2): Descendants of the intestate to the remotest degree stand in the place of their parent or other ancestor, and take according to their stocks the share which he or she would have taken.' Betty predeceased, leaving three children (grandchildren). Under the per stirpes rule, Betty's children 'stand in the place of their parent' and 'take according to their stocks the share which [Betty] would have taken.' Betty would have taken 50% (one of two children). Betty's three children collectively take Betty's 50% and divide it equally among themselves: 50% ÷ 3 = 16.67% each. Adam receives his 50% as a surviving child. Total: Adam 50%, each grandchild 16.67%.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores the per stirpes rule in ISA Rule 3. When a child of the intestate predeceases, leaving descendants (grandchildren), those descendants take their parent's share. The notes state: 'Proviso No. (1): The persons who legally represent the children of an intestate are their descendants and not their next-of-kin.' Betty's three children represent her and take her 50% share. If Betty's children did not take, the deceased's grandchildren would be disinherited merely because their parent predeceased - this would be unfair and contrary to the per stirpes principle. The purpose of per stirpes is to ensure representation - descendants inherit through their parent's line. The answer incorrectly gives Adam the entire estate.",
          "C": "This treats each grandchild as equal to Adam (each of the four people gets 25%), which is incorrect. This is per capita distribution (equal division among all beneficiaries at the same generational level), not per stirpes. Per stirpes means distribution by family branch: Adam (one branch) gets 50%, Betty's branch gets 50% (which Betty's three children share). Each branch gets an equal share at the children's level, then within each branch, distribution occurs. If per capita applied, all four individuals (Adam and three grandchildren) would share equally (25% each), but this would disadvantage Adam (who is a child, closer relation) compared to grandchildren (further removed relation). Per stirpes respects family branches. The answer incorrectly applies per capita distribution.",
          "D": "This is incorrect for the same reason as answer C - it applies per capita (25% each to four people) rather than per stirpes (50% to each of two branches, with Betty's branch subdivided among her three children). ISA Rule 3 specifically states 'per stirpes,' not per capita. The notes emphasize: 'take according to their stocks the share which he or she would have taken' - 'stocks' means family branches. Betty's stock (branch) gets 50%, not 75% (which would be 3 × 25% if each grandchild got equal share with Adam). The answer incorrectly equalizes different generational levels."

      "question": "Deceased dies intestate survived only by her illegitimate child (child born out of wedlock; parents never married). The deceased was the child's mother. Under the Legitimacy Act and ISA, how is the estate distributed?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The child receives nothing because illegitimate children cannot inherit under ISA.",
        "B": "The child receives 100% of the mother's estate under section 10(2) Legitimacy Act.",
        "C": "The estate goes to the deceased's parents or siblings; the child is excluded.",
        "D": "The child receives 50%; the other 50% goes to the Government as the child is illegitimate."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The illegitimate child inherits the mother's estate. The notes state: 'Legitimacy Act section 10(2): Where, on or after 18 May 1934, the mother of an illegitimate child, the child not being a legitimated person, dies intestate as respects all or any of her property, and does not leave any legitimate issue her surviving, the illegitimate child, or if he is dead his issue, shall be entitled to take any interest therein to which he or his issue would have been entitled if he had been born legitimate.' This allows illegitimate children to inherit from their mothers. Here, the deceased (mother) died intestate with no spouse and one illegitimate child. The child 'is not a legitimated person' (parents never married, so no legitimation under s 3). Under s 10(2), the illegitimate child inherits as if legitimate. Under ISA (if the child were legitimate): no spouse, only issue → issue receives 100%. Therefore, the illegitimate child receives 100% of the mother's estate. Section 10(2) provides symmetrical rights for illegitimate children vis-à-vis mothers: child can inherit from mother, mother can inherit from child.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This would have been correct under old common law, but is wrong under modern Singapore law. The Legitimacy Act section 10(2) specifically allows illegitimate children to inherit from their mothers (and mothers from illegitimate children). The notes explain s 10(2) creates an exception to the general ISA rule. While ISA's definition of 'child' is 'legitimate child' (excluding illegitimate children), s 10(2) supplements this for intestate estates of mothers of illegitimate children. The policy is to protect illegitimate children who should not suffer for their parents' failure to marry. At a minimum, the mother-child relationship should allow inheritance. The answer incorrectly applies the restrictive ISA definition without considering the Legitimacy Act exception.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because s 10(2) Legitimacy Act gives the illegitimate child priority over the mother's other relatives. The section states the child 'shall be entitled to take any interest' in the mother's estate to which the child would be entitled 'if he had been born legitimate.' If the child were legitimate, under ISA the child would take as issue (100% if no spouse, or 50% if there were a spouse). Here, there is no spouse mentioned, so the child takes 100%. The deceased's parents or siblings (if any exist) receive nothing because issue takes priority under ISA Rule 3 over parents (Rule 5) and siblings (Rule 6). The answer incorrectly gives priority to parents/siblings over the illegitimate child.",
          "D": "This invents a 50-50 split that has no basis in s 10(2) or ISA. Section 10(2) provides that the illegitimate child takes 'to which he or his issue would have been entitled if he had been born legitimate' - this is 100% if the child is the only issue and there is no spouse. There is no reduction to 50% merely because the child is illegitimate. The whole point of s 10(2) is to treat the child as if legitimate for inheritance purposes. Furthermore, the other 50% going to the Government makes no sense - the Government takes under Rule 9 only if there are absolutely no qualifying relatives, which is not the case here (the child qualifies). The answer incorrectly penalizes the illegitimate child and invents a Government share."

      "question": "Deceased died domiciled in Singapore leaving a will that gives the entire estate to charity. Deceased's adult daughter, who is financially independent and earning $150,000 annually, applies under IFPA for maintenance from the estate. The estate is valued at $500,000. Should the court order provision for the daughter?",

        "D": "No, unless the daughter can show the deceased's reasons for excluding her were unreasonable."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The court should not order provision for the financially independent daughter. While the daughter qualifies as a 'dependent' under s 2 IFPA (son and daughter are defined dependents), the court must determine whether 'reasonable provision for maintenance' is needed. Section 3(6) IFPA provides: 'The court shall... have regard to any past, present or future capital or income from any source of the dependant.' Here, the daughter earns $150,000 annually and is financially independent. She does not need maintenance from the $500,000 estate. The notes explain: 'The IFPA is concerned with maintenance and not the creation of legacies' (AKN v ALC) and 'the IFPA was... limited to the provision of reasonable maintenance and not for the purpose of obtaining legacies out of the testator's estate' (APZ v AQA). Maintenance means providing for necessary living expenses, not creating inheritances. A financially independent daughter earning $150,000 annually has no maintenance need. The deceased's testamentary freedom to give the estate to charity should be respected. The daughter may be disappointed at being excluded, but IFPA is not about satisfying expectations - it is about meeting maintenance needs.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "While daughters are defined as dependents under s 2 IFPA (eligible to apply), this does not mean they automatically receive provision regardless of circumstances. The notes emphasize: 'The IFPA is concerned with maintenance and not the creation of legacies.' Section 3(1) requires the court to determine whether the will makes 'reasonable provision for the maintenance of that dependant.' If the dependent does not need maintenance (because they are financially independent), then no provision is warranted. Furthermore, s 3(6) requires the court to 'have regard to any past, present or future capital or income from any source of the dependant.' Here, the daughter's $150,000 income shows she does not need maintenance. Being a defined dependent is a threshold requirement (standing to apply), not a guarantee of provision. The answer incorrectly treats dependent status as automatically entitling provision.",
          "C": "While moral duty is a relevant consideration in some jurisdictions' family provision legislation, the notes do not indicate this is the test under Singapore's IFPA. The statutory test is 'reasonable provision for the maintenance of that dependant' (s 3(1)). The court considers factors in s 3(5), (6), (7): nature of the estate, the dependent's income/capital, conduct, the deceased's reasons for exclusion, and other relevant matters. Moral duty might be implicit in assessing whether maintenance is reasonable, but it is not a separate requirement the dependent must prove. The daughter's financial independence is more directly relevant under s 3(6). The answer imposes a moral duty requirement not found in IFPA.",

Two conditions must both be met for the bar to apply: (1) surviving spouse entitled to ≥ 2/3 of estate income, AND (2) the only other dependent(s) are child(ren) of the surviving spouse. Here: (1) spouse receives 70% (≥ 2/3), AND (2) the only other dependents are the son and daughter, both children of the surviving spouse. Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the bar applies. The spouse cannot apply, the son cannot apply, and the daughter cannot apply - all are barred.

The spouse gets 70% and the only other dependents (son and daughter) are her children. The bar applies to 'such surviving spouse or such child' - meaning both the spouse and her children are barred.

Even if the daughter were destitute and in urgent need, she would be barred if the two conditions are met. Conversely, even if she were wealthy and financially independent, she would still be barred (and would also fail on the merits even if allowed to apply, but that is a separate issue).

Section 4(1) sets the general 6-month limitation from the grant. Here, the grant was 7 months ago, so the 6-month period expired one month ago. However, s 4(2) allows the court to extend this period if it would 'operate unfairly.' Circumstances that might support extension include: the dependent was unaware of the death/grant, the dependent was ill or incapacitated, the dependent was misled about their rights, or other circumstances making the strict 6-month period unfair.

The purpose of allowing extensions is to provide flexibility in cases where strict application would be unfair (e.g., dependent was unaware of rights, was ill, or had other valid reasons for delay).

This is a fallback allowing very late applications (beyond even s 4(2) extensions) but only affecting certain property (property whose income is currently applicable for maintenance). However, the better approach for the daughter (only one month late) is to seek extension under s 4(2) first, which would allow a full IFPA claim without limitation to specific property.

Section 4(2) is discretionary: 'if the Court is satisfied that the 6 months would operate unfairly.' This gives the court broad discretion to consider all circumstances. The answer incorrectly limits extension to unawareness when various factors might support extension."

Section 3(4) creates an exception to the general rule that IFPA provides maintenance through periodical payments. The general rule from s 3(2) and APZ v AQA is that maintenance is by periodical payments (monthly or annual payments), not lump sums (which would be 'creating legacies'). However, for small estates (under $50,000), administering periodical payments would be impractical - the costs of ongoing administration might consume significant estate value. Section 3(4) allows lump sum payments for such estates.

The Court also held: 'The IFPA is concerned with maintenance and not the creation of legacies. The appellant's prayers were far in excess of what constituted reasonable maintenance under the IFPA. In claiming for half of the testator's estate, the appellant was seeking to incorporate the provisions of the Women's Charter concerning just and equitable division of matrimonial assets between divorcing parties into the IFPA. The Court of Appeal said they had no power to do so.' Here, the widow's $20,000 monthly request or $7.2 million lump sum (half the $15M estate) is far in excess of maintenance. Given that she has income exceeding her expenses and received substantial lifetime gifts, she has no unmet maintenance needs. IFPA is not about equal division or creating legacies, but about meeting maintenance needs.",

The notes show the court found '$20,000 a month or... $7.2 million' to be 'far in excess of what constituted reasonable maintenance.' The widow in that case (like here) had income exceeding her expenses and had received inter vivos gifts. The court refused provision. IFPA is about maintenance (meeting living expenses), not about giving widows large shares of estates. If the widow's expenses are $5,000 monthly and she has income of $6,000 monthly, she has no maintenance deficit. Giving her $20,000 monthly or a $7.2M lump sum would be creating a legacy, not providing maintenance. The answer incorrectly grants excessive provision that AKN v ALC specifically rejected.",

The Women's Charter allows family courts to divide matrimonial assets between divorcing spouses based on contributions and fairness (often 50-50 or similar). But IFPA is different - it is about maintenance, not equitable division. The widow is not divorcing (the deceased is dead); she is seeking provision from the estate. IFPA does not entitle widows to half the estate or any fixed share. It entitles them to reasonable maintenance based on needs. The answer incorrectly applies Women's Charter principles to IFPA.",

The notes from AKN v ALC show that both the lump sum AND the monthly payments were rejected. The issue is not the form of payment (lump sum vs periodical), but the amount requested. $20,000 monthly far exceeds reasonable maintenance for a widow with income exceeding expenses. The court would reject both forms of the excessive request. The answer is partially correct about lump sums being unavailable for large estates, but incorrect in suggesting monthly payments should be granted."

The notes explain this means the court should not order sale or realization of property when this would be improvident (lacking foresight, imprudent). Here, the house generates $10,000 monthly rental income, and the son needs $8,000 monthly maintenance. The maintenance can be satisfied from the rental income without selling the house. Ordering sale would be improvident because: (1) it destroys a rental income stream that can fund maintenance, (2) it may force a rushed sale at poor prices, (3) it may trigger tax consequences, and (4) it reduces the estate for other beneficiaries (whoever is entitled to the house after the son's maintenance is met). The court should order $8,000 monthly from rental income, not sale of the house.",

Ordering sale of a $5M house that generates sufficient rental income ($10K/month) to meet the son's needs ($8K/month) would be improvident. The income stream can fund the maintenance without depleting capital. If sale were allowed whenever maintenance was needed, estates would be unnecessarily liquidated when income could satisfy needs. The policy is to preserve estate assets while meeting maintenance needs through income. The answer incorrectly suggests sale is allowed without considering whether it is improvident.",

Section 3(5) does not say 'sale is allowed only if income is insufficient' - it says 'shall not order... realisation that would be improvident.' Whether income is sufficient is one factor in determining improvidence, but the analysis is broader. Even if income were insufficient, sale might still be improvident if: (1) the shortfall is small and can be met by partial sale or mortgage, (2) sale would be at a bad time (poor market), (3) other estate assets could be used. The court must consider whether realization is improvident having regard to all circumstances. Answer B more clearly states the legal rule (no improvident realization) rather than describing one factor.",

The notes from APZ v AQA explain that lump sum capital payments are generally not allowed (creating legacies), but s 3(4) is an exception. Furthermore, if the estate has no income-producing assets, capital must be used. The answer overstates the prohibition on capital use.

If the father must exhaust savings before applying, by the time a maintenance order is made and takes effect, he might be penniless and unable to pay for immediate needs. The MPA allows applications while the parent still has some resources but can foresee those resources being inadequate. The answer incorrectly requires the father to exhaust savings before applying.",
          "C": "This is incorrect for similar reasons as answer B. The MPA does not require complete exhaustion of savings before applying. Section 3(5) asks whether 'total or expected income and other financial resources are inadequate' - this is a forward-looking assessment. The father can foresee that his $30,000 will be exhausted in 20 months. This makes his resources inadequate. He can apply now. Furthermore, requiring complete exhaustion before application would leave a gap period where the parent has no money and is waiting for the maintenance order to take effect (which can take time). The MPA sensibly allows applications when inadequacy is evident, even if some resources remain temporarily. The answer invents an exhaustion requirement not in the statute.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the standard is not destitution but inability to maintain 'adequately.' Section 3(1) uses 'unable to maintain himself... adequately,' not 'destitute' or 'having no resources.' Section 3(5) clarifies: resources inadequate to provide 'basic amenities and basic physical needs including... shelter, food, medical costs and clothing.' The father has some resources ($30,000) but these are inadequate for long-term provision of basic needs (will run out in 20 months with no income). He is unable to maintain adequately. If the test were destitution, parents would need to be homeless and starving before applying. The MPA's threshold is lower - inability to maintain adequate standard of basic living. The answer incorrectly imposes a destitution standard."

Section 5(1) MPA provides: 'The Tribunal may make a maintenance order against a respondent in respect of the respondent's parent if it considers that it is just and equitable that the respondent should maintain the parent and that — (a) the respondent is able to provide maintenance to the parent after the respondent's own requirements and those of his or her spouse and his or her children have been supplied; and (b) the parent is unable, in spite of efforts on his or her part, to maintain himself or herself through work or from his or her property or from any other source.' Condition (a) requires the Tribunal to determine if the son 'is able to provide maintenance... after the respondent's own requirements and those of his... spouse and his... children have been supplied.' Here, the son earns $6,000 but spends $5,500 on his own family, leaving only $500. The Tribunal must assess: (1) whether $500/month is available, (2) what amount is just and equitable considering all circumstances. The answer might be $200-300 monthly, or $0 if the son truly cannot afford it. The Tribunal has discretion based on 'just and equitable.'",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because MPA does not impose an absolute duty. Section 5(1) requires the Tribunal to find it 'just and equitable' and that the child 'is able to provide maintenance... after the respondent's own requirements and those of his or her spouse and his or her children have been supplied.' This explicitly recognizes that children have their own obligations (to spouse, children) that take priority or must be balanced. If children could not afford to pay (e.g., unemployed, heavy debts, large family), the Tribunal would not order maintenance or would order a reduced amount. The MPA balances filial duty against children's own circumstances. The answer incorrectly states absolute duty without considering the 'able to provide' and 'just and equitable' requirements.",
          "C": "While a nominal amount might be one possible outcome, the answer assumes the Tribunal MUST order something. Section 5(1) allows the Tribunal to make an order 'if it considers that it is just and equitable' - this is discretionary, not mandatory. If the son truly cannot afford maintenance (after family expenses), the Tribunal might order $0. Alternatively, if $500/month is available and the mother needs $300, the Tribunal might order $300. The Tribunal is not obligated to order a nominal amount merely to affirm the principle of filial duty. The answer assumes a nominal order when the Tribunal might order nothing or a substantial amount depending on circumstances.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because it creates an absolute priority for children's own families over parents, which is too strict. Section 5(1)(a) requires the child to provide maintenance 'after' their own family's requirements are supplied - this means those requirements should be met first, but it does not mean any family expenses preclude maintenance. The Tribunal assesses: (1) what are reasonable 'requirements' (not all expenses, but necessary ones), and (2) what is left over for the parent. Here, the son has $500/month surplus. Even if most goes to his family, the Tribunal might find $200 is available and order that. The duty to wife/children does not 'override' duty to parents - rather, the Tribunal balances both under 'just and equitable.' The answer incorrectly creates absolute priority."

        "correct": "She can apply under the infirmity exception in s 3(6) MPA. The notes state: 'Even though a person is below the minimum age specified in subsection (1), this Act applies to that person if the Tribunal is satisfied that the person is suffering from infirmity of mind or body which prevents the person from maintaining or makes it difficult for the person to maintain himself or herself or that there is any other special reason.' Section 3(1) sets the general age requirement at 60, but s 3(6) creates exceptions for: (1) infirmity of mind or body preventing or making it difficult to maintain oneself, or (2) other special reasons. Here, the parent is 55 (under 60) but suffers 'severe physical disability that prevents her from working.' This is an 'infirmity of mind or body which prevents the person from maintaining' herself. If the Tribunal is satisfied of this infirmity, the MPA applies despite the parent being under 60. The parent can apply, and the Tribunal will assess whether maintenance should be ordered under s 5 (just and equitable, child able to provide, etc.). The infirmity exception recognizes that disabled persons may need support before reaching 60.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 3(6) MPA creates an exception for persons under 60 who suffer from infirmity. If the parent must wait until 60, she would need to survive 5 more years without income or support, which could be impossible given her disability. Section 3(6) prevents this harsh result by allowing earlier applications when infirmity prevents self-maintenance. The answer ignores the s 3(6) exception.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because IFPA and MPA serve different purposes and have different applicability. IFPA allows dependents to claim maintenance from a deceased person's estate. It requires someone to have died. MPA allows parents to claim maintenance from their living children. Here, the parent is alive and her children are alive - this is MPA territory, not IFPA. The parent cannot apply under IFPA because no one has died. If the parent dies, she obviously cannot apply (and her children might have IFPA claims against her estate if she left property, but that is different). The answer confuses the two statutes.",
          "D": "While s 5(1)(b) MPA requires the parent to be 'unable, in spite of efforts on his or her part, to maintain himself or herself through work or from his or her property or from any other source,' this is an assessment the Tribunal makes after the application is filed. It is not a prerequisite for the application itself. Section 3(6) only requires that the parent be suffering from infirmity that prevents or makes it difficult to maintain herself. If the parent has made no efforts to find work, this might be relevant to whether maintenance should be ordered (s 5 assessment), but does not prevent the application from being filed. The answer conflates the application requirement (s 3 - who can apply) with the merits assessment (s 5 - whether maintenance should be ordered)."

Section 7(1)(a) provides that unsecured maintenance expires upon the earlier of: (1) parent's death, or (2) respondent's death. Here, the son (respondent) died. If the maintenance was unsecured (the common situation - secured maintenance would require the son to set aside property or provide security), the order expires. The son's estate has no obligation to continue paying. The mother loses this source of maintenance. She could: (1) apply for a new maintenance order against the son's siblings (her other children) under s 3, or (2) if she is destitute, seek public assistance. The policy is that maintenance is a personal obligation of the living child, not an estate obligation after death.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This would be correct only if the maintenance was SECURED under s 7(1)(b). Secured maintenance continues until the parent's death even if the respondent dies, because the security (property set aside or charged) can continue generating funds. But most maintenance orders are unsecured (simple order to pay from the respondent's income). For unsecured maintenance, s 7(1)(a) provides the order expires on 'the death of the parent or the respondent, whichever is the earlier.' The son's death triggers expiry. The answer incorrectly assumes secured maintenance when unsecured is more common.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the maintenance obligation does not automatically transfer to siblings upon the respondent's death. Each child's maintenance obligation is determined separately by the Tribunal under s 3 applications and s 5 orders. If the mother has other children, she can apply to the Tribunal for maintenance orders against them under s 3. But there is no automatic transfer. Furthermore, the notes state: 'Where a maintenance order was made against more than one respondent, the death of a respondent does not affect the liability of the others to continue paying maintenance to the applicant' (s 7(2)). This suggests that if the original order was against multiple children, the others continue paying, but here the order was only against the son. The mother must make new applications against siblings. The answer incorrectly suggests automatic transfer.",

The MPA provides for maintenance from living children, not from deceased children's estates. Section 3(1) allows applications to 'the Tribunal for an order that one or more of the person's children pay.' The son is dead and cannot pay. His estate is not his 'child' that can be ordered to pay. If the mother wants maintenance after the son's death, she must apply against her other living children (if any). The answer invents a mechanism for ordering estates to pay under MPA."

The phrase 'weight, if any' suggests the court might give the statement significant, little, or no weight depending on circumstances. 'Accuracy or otherwise' indicates the court assesses whether the statement is true, not merely whether it exists.

The test is whether the will makes 'reasonable provision for maintenance' (s 3(1)), not whether the deceased had good reasons for the disposition. A testator might have valid reasons for excluding a dependent (e.g., the dependent is wealthy, has been abusive, etc.), and these reasons are relevant, but they do not automatically defeat IFPA.

Therefore, if an order for provision of maintenance was to be made under section 3(1), the statutorily prescribed method for provision of maintenance out of the net estate was by way of periodical payments.' Section 3(4) allows lump sum 'if the deceased's net estate does not exceed $50,000 in value.' Here, the estate is $2 million, far exceeding $50,000. Therefore, only periodical payments are allowed. The notes explain the policy: 'The IFPA is concerned with maintenance and not the creation of legacies... The appellant's prayers were far in excess of what constituted reasonable maintenance under the IFPA.' Giving an infant $250,000 lump sum is creating a legacy, not providing maintenance. The court should order monthly/annual payments for the son's maintenance (food, shelter, education, medical, etc.) calculated based on reasonable expenses, not a lump sum capital payment.",

The notes from APZ v AQA directly address this: the court refused a $250,000 lump sum request, holding that 'the IFPA was... limited to the provision of reasonable maintenance and not for the purpose of obtaining legacies' and 'Outside of section 3(4), the IFPA did not envisage any capital payment.' For a $2 million estate (over $50K), only periodical payments are allowed. Furthermore, even if lump sums were allowed, $250,000 would likely be excessive for an 8-year-old's maintenance (creating a legacy rather than meeting maintenance needs). The answer is wrong on both the form (lump sum not allowed) and amount (excessive).",

The son's education and upbringing needs can be met through periodical payments. The court can order monthly payments calculated to cover living expenses, school fees, medical bills, etc. These periodical payments provide for education and upbringing without giving a capital lump sum. If lump sums were allowed whenever 'necessary,' the $50K limit in s 3(4) would be meaningless. The answer incorrectly allows lump sums based on necessity.",

The words \"when realised\" in s 2 IFPA suggested, as a matter of construction, that the annual income had to be received by the estate before it could be distributed.' Section 3(3) limits periodical payments to the annual income of the estate. Here, the estate generates $20,000 annual income (=$1,667 monthly). The daughter's request for $3,000 monthly (=$36,000 annually) exceeds this limit significantly. The maximum the court can order is $1,667 monthly (if the full income is allocated to her), or less if there are other dependents or beneficiaries with claims. The policy is that IFPA provides maintenance from income, not by consuming capital. If payments exceed income, capital would be depleted over time (creating a legacy rather than sustainable maintenance). The answer is no - the court cannot order $3,000 monthly; maximum is $1,667 monthly (and possibly less depending on other factors).",

Even if the daughter truly needs $3,000 monthly for basic living (high medical costs, etc.), s 3(3) caps periodical payments at the estate's annual income ($20,000 = $1,667/month). If the daughter's needs exceed this, she must seek other resources (her own work, public assistance, help from other family). IFPA cannot provide more than the estate can sustainably generate. If needs-based ordering were allowed without regard to income limits, estates would be depleted, violating the principle that IFPA creates maintenance (sustainable support) not legacies (capital distributions). The answer incorrectly prioritizes needs over statutory limits.",

While the court could theoretically order partial sale of capital to invest in higher-income assets (e.g., sell $200K of capital, invest in bonds generating higher yield), this would be 'realization' that might be 'improvident.' Section 3(5) states: 'the court shall... not order any such provision to be made as would necessitate a realisation that would be improvident... having regard to the interests of the deceased's dependants and of the person who, apart from the order, would be entitled to that property.' Forcing realization to boost income for one dependent would reduce the estate available for other beneficiaries. Furthermore, such realization might not guarantee higher income and creates risks. The better approach is to order maintenance within existing income, not to restructure the estate. The answer suggests a strategy not clearly supported by IFPA.",
          "D": "This is incorrect for similar reasons as answer C. Selling assets to create income is a form of realization potentially barred by s 3(5) as improvident. Furthermore, the notes from APZ v AQA emphasize: 'periodic payments were not to be at an annual rate that exceeded the annual income of the net estate' and 'the annual income had to be received by the estate before it could be distributed.' This suggests the court works with existing income, not with income that could be generated by restructuring the estate. If the court could order sales to create income, the annual income limit would be meaningless (could always create more income by selling capital).

This provision recognizes that while ISA aims to provide fairly for family members, the statutory distribution might not meet every dependent's maintenance needs. For example, under ISA, a daughter receives a share as issue, but if she has special needs (disability, no income, etc.) while other beneficiaries are wealthy, her ISA share might be inadequate for her maintenance. Section 3(8) allows the court to consider IFPA claims against intestate estates without presuming ISA distribution is adequate.

If courts were required to presume intestacy is always reasonable, s 3(8) would be unnecessary. The provision exists precisely to clarify that IFPA can apply to intestate estates - the court can find intestacy distribution inadequate and order variation. The policy is that some dependents may have greater needs than ISA contemplates, and IFPA provides a safety net. The answer incorrectly creates a presumption that s 3(8) rejects.",

Furthermore, s 3(8) specifically addresses intestacy distribution, confirming IFPA's applicability. If IFPA only applied to wills, huge numbers of estates (those dying intestate) would be exempt from dependents' maintenance claims. This would create an arbitrary distinction: dependents can claim against testate estates but not intestate estates. The law avoids this by allowing IFPA claims against both testate and intestate estates. The answer incorrectly limits IFPA to testamentary dispositions.",

While intestacy distributions are statutory (prescribed by ISA s 7 rules), IFPA provides an overlay allowing courts to vary these distributions when they fail to make reasonable provision for dependents. The interplay is: (1) ISA determines who gets what (the default distribution), (2) IFPA allows dependents to seek variation if their maintenance is inadequate, (3) s 3(8) prevents courts from presuming ISA is always adequate. The court can order that the daughter receive more than her ISA share (or receive something if she would get nothing under ISA) if necessary for her maintenance. This 'challenges' the intestacy result but is expressly authorized by IFPA. The answer incorrectly treats statutory distributions as immune from IFPA."

(b) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of the parent, and the manner in which the parent has spent his or her savings or dissipated his or her financial resources.' This makes the parent's dissipation of savings a relevant factor but not determinative. The Tribunal considers it along with: (a) parent's financial needs, (c) parent's disabilities, (d) child's income and resources, (e) child's own family expenses, (f) child's past contributions to parent. The fact that the parent gambled away savings is relevant (suggests irresponsibility, might reduce the amount ordered, might indicate the parent should be given smaller periodic amounts rather than lump sums), but does not automatically bar the application. Parents still have basic maintenance needs (food, shelter, medical care) even if they were financially irresponsible. Filial duty does not disappear due to the parent's past conduct.

The Tribunal has discretion to weigh the dissipation against other factors. The parent's gambling is reprehensible, but he is now 68 and destitute. Denying all maintenance would leave him without basic needs (food, shelter, medical care). The MPA aims to prevent elderly parents from destitution, even if they contributed to their situation. The Tribunal might order reduced maintenance (e.g., $300/month instead of $800, or paid directly to a care facility rather than to the parent to prevent further gambling), but is not required to dismiss.

How the parent spent savings is material to assessing: (1) whether the parent truly needs maintenance or caused his own problem, (2) how much should be ordered (might order less for irresponsible parent), (3) how it should be paid (might order payment to care facility rather than directly). While dissipation does not automatically bar the claim, it is a factor that can reduce or modify the order. The answer incorrectly ignores a statutory factor.",

If a 5-year bar existed, many elderly parents would be destitute for 5 years (possibly dying in that time) before they could apply.

Here, the son is 18 and will receive payments until he turns 21 (3 years). If he dies before 21, payments stop at death. This makes sense - maintenance is for the dependent's living expenses, so death ends the need. The age 21 limit for infant sons reflects that adult children are expected to support themselves.

Rules 7 and 8 create a hierarchy: grandparents (Rule 7) take priority over uncles/aunts (Rule 8). Rule 8 applies only 'if there are no... grandparents' - meaning uncles/aunts take only when grandparents do not exist. Here, two grandparents survive. Under Rule 7, they take the entire estate in equal portions (50% each). The uncles do not take because Rule 8 is not reached (grandparents exist, so Rule 7 applies and exhausts the estate).

Although the specific MPA provision for variation is not quoted in the notes, maintenance orders generally can be varied when circumstances change substantially. Here, the daughter's promotion and 50% salary increase is a substantial change in circumstances. Her ability to pay has increased significantly. The father can apply to the Tribunal to vary the order, increasing the monthly amount based on the daughter's improved financial situation. The Tribunal will assess whether increase is just and equitable under s 5 principles, considering the daughter's new income against her own family's needs. Variation allows maintenance to remain appropriate as circumstances evolve, rather than being fixed permanently at the original level.",

If orders were permanently fixed, they would become inappropriate over time as circumstances change (payor's income increases or decreases, parent's needs change, etc.). The notes from IFPA show variation is possible for 'substantial change... in circumstances.' While the MPA variation provision is not explicitly quoted, similar flexibility should exist. Maintenance is an ongoing obligation that must adapt to changing realities. If the daughter's income doubles but the order remains fixed, this would be unfair (daughter could easily pay more, father's needs may have increased due to inflation/medical costs).

When these change substantially (50% salary increase), variation may be appropriate even if the parent's needs did not change. The daughter can now afford more, and it may be just and equitable to increase the order. Furthermore, the father's needs may have increased due to inflation, medical costs, etc., even if his basic lifestyle is the same.

The father does not need to prove the daughter hid income initially - the promotion happened after the order was made (a subsequent change, not prior concealment). If the daughter had hidden income when the order was made, that would be ground for variation based on non-disclosure, but that is not this case. The answer incorrectly requires proof of fraud when changed circumstances are the ground."

Here, the parent is 'unable to make an application' due to 'mental infirmity' (mental incapacity). His sister is a 'family member of the parent' under s 11(1)(a). Therefore, she can apply on his behalf. The MPA recognizes that incapacitated parents cannot protect their own interests and need others to act for them. The statute lists three categories of persons who can apply: family members (siblings, children from whom maintenance is not sought, etc.), caregivers (nursing homes, relatives providing care), and authorized persons (if the parent gave authority before incapacity). The sister qualifies as a family member.",

Deputies/donees might fit category (c), but family members and caregivers can also apply without being appointed under MCA. Here, the sister is a family member under (a).

The sister, as a family member, can apply on behalf of the incapacitated parent without any prior authorization. If authorization were required, parents would need to anticipate incapacity and give authorization in advance (like an LPA), which many would not do.

Here, all four children are the deceased's issue (whether from first or second marriage is irrelevant). The second wife receives one-half ($300,000). The remaining half ($300,000) is divided equally among the four children: $300,000 ÷ 4 = $75,000 each. Total: second wife $300K, each child $75K.

This means the will (or intestacy rules) remains the framework for distribution, but is varied to accommodate the IFPA order. For example, if the will gives the estate to the son, and the IFPA order requires $1,500 monthly for the daughter, the variation might be: the son receives the estate subject to paying $1,500 monthly to the daughter (or a portion of the estate is set aside to generate income for the daughter).

The will or intestacy remains the basic framework, with variations to accommodate maintenance. If the will gives specific gifts to various beneficiaries and the residue to the son, these provisions remain effective except as varied for the maintenance order. The son might receive the residue minus the portion needed to generate $1,500 monthly for the daughter, but the rest of the will operates as written.

Section 5(1) provides variations to the will/intestacy to 'give effect to the provision for maintenance' - this suggests the maintenance replaces or supplements her will/intestacy share, not that she gets both fully. For example, if the will gave the daughter nothing, the IFPA order might vary this by giving her $1,500 monthly (increasing from zero). If the will gave her $200,000 lump sum, the IFPA order might vary this by also giving ongoing $1,500 monthly (supplementing).

This means the variations operate retroactively from death, not just going forward. If the executor already distributed the estate according to the will before the IFPA order was made, the executor may need to recover funds from beneficiaries or make adjustments. The IFPA order is not merely prospective - it restructures the distribution from death. This is important for tax purposes and to ensure the daughter receives maintenance from death (or from the date the order specifies), not just from the date of the order.

This establishes that whole-blood siblings take priority over half-blood siblings. Here, one sister is whole-blood (shares both parents with deceased) and one is half-blood (shares only one parent). Under s 6(b), the whole-blood sister 'ranks' before the half-blood sister. 'Immediately after' means the half-blood sibling is next in line but takes only if there are no whole-blood siblings. Since a whole-blood sister exists, she takes the entire estate (100%). The half-blood sister receives nothing.

Here, at the deceased's death, the whole-blood sister survives, so she takes 100%. What happens subsequently (if the whole-blood sister later dies) does not affect the intestacy distribution which is finalized at the deceased's death.

If a testator had made adequate inter vivos provisions for the persons entitled under section 3(1), the court should not interfere with his right to determine who should have the benefit of his estate.' Similarly, the notes from APZ v AQA mention: 'in light of the inter vivos gifts that the testator had given to the appellant... there was no need to disturb the decision made by the High Court not to allow any further provision under the IFPA.' Here, the daughter received $500,000 during the deceased's lifetime. The court should assess whether this is adequate provision for her maintenance. If the $500,000 is invested and generates sufficient income for her living expenses, or if she can use the capital for maintenance, she may have no unmet maintenance needs. The deceased made provision (through lifetime gifts), just not in the will. IFPA looks at overall provision, not just testamentary provision.",

The notes emphasize that courts 'ought to consider any inter vivos gift' and 'If a testator had made adequate inter vivos provisions... the court should not interfere.' Here, the $500,000 lifetime gift may be adequate provision. If the daughter has sufficient income from this gift, or can use the capital for maintenance, the will's exclusion of her from the additional $300,000 estate might be reasonable (the deceased wanted to benefit charity, having already provided for the daughter).

The test is 'reasonable provision for maintenance,' not comparison to intestate shares. Section 3(8) IFPA states: 'The court... shall not be bound to assume that the law relating to intestacy makes reasonable provision in all cases.' So intestate shares are not the benchmark. The relevant question is: did the deceased make reasonable provision for the daughter's maintenance? The $500,000 inter vivos gift might be adequate for maintenance even though it exceeds the intestate share. Conversely, if it were less than the intestate share but still adequate for maintenance, that might also be reasonable. The answer incorrectly uses intestate share as the measure instead of maintenance needs.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because IFPA does not operate as a mathematical set-off or reduction based on inter vivos gifts. The court does not calculate: intestate share minus inter vivos gifts = IFPA entitlement. Rather, the court assesses whether reasonable provision for maintenance has been made considering all circumstances, including inter vivos gifts. If the $500,000 is adequate provision (generates sufficient income, meets her needs), the answer is $0 further provision, not a reduced amount. If the $500,000 is inadequate (perhaps she squandered it, or it generates insufficient income), the court might order maintenance, but this is based on her current needs, not on a formula subtracting past gifts.

        "correct": "The estate goes to the Government as bona vacantia. The notes state: 'Rule 9: bona vacantia; In default of distribution under the foregoing rules the Government shall be entitled to the whole of the estate.' When an intestate dies with no surviving relatives qualifying under Rules 1-8 (no spouse, descendants, parents, siblings and their children, grandparents, or uncles/aunts), Rule 9 applies: the entire estate goes to the Government of Singapore. 'Bona vacantia' means 'ownerless goods' - property with no private owner. The Government takes as the ultimate heir when private succession fails. This is an ancient common law rule preventing property from being ownerless. The Government receives the property absolutely, not as trustee. Here, with no qualifying relatives, Rule 9 applies and the Government takes the entire estate. The practical effect is that the estate is paid to a government agency (likely Ministry of Finance or similar), and the deceased's property becomes state property.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because ISA does not provide for holding estates in trust pending discovery of relatives. Rule 9 applies when there are no qualifying relatives under Rules 1-8 at the time of death. If relatives are later discovered who did qualify, they could potentially challenge the distribution, but the statute does not create a trust. The Government takes immediately under Rule 9. If someone later claims to be a qualifying relative (e.g., a long-lost child), they would need to prove their status and might recover the estate from the Government. But the initial distribution is to the Government, not to a trust. The answer invents a trust mechanism not in ISA.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because friends and caregivers are not beneficiaries under ISA. Intestacy law is based on blood relationship (and marriage). Friends, no matter how close, cannot inherit under intestacy. If the deceased wanted friends or caregivers to inherit, the deceased needed a will. ISA provides a hierarchy of family members (spouse, descendants, parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles/aunts), and if none exist, the Government takes (Rule 9). There is no provision for friends, caregivers, or 'deserving persons.' The answer invents a category of beneficiaries not in ISA.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because the Public Trustee does not have general power to distribute bona vacantia estates to charity. Rule 9 provides the estate goes 'to the Government' - this means the Government as sovereign, not the Public Trustee for discretionary distribution. The Government takes the property as owner. While the Government might choose to use the funds for public purposes (which could include charitable purposes in a broad sense), this is a governmental decision, not a Public Trustee decision to distribute to private charities. The answer confuses the Public Trustee's role in administering intestate estates where relatives exist (as administrator until a grant is obtained) with bona vacantia (where the Government takes ownership)."

The 6-month period runs from the date of the grant, not from death. Here, the grant was 6 months ago, and the widow applies 'now' - meaning she is applying right at or within the 6-month deadline. Even if she is exactly at the 6-month mark (grant was exactly 6 months ago today), the limit is 'no later than 6 months,' so applying at 6 months should be timely (interpreting 'no later than' as up to and including the 6-month date). She is within time. The fact that distribution has not occurred is actually helpful - it means the executor can comply with any IFPA order without needing to recover funds from beneficiaries. The executor should be aware of potential IFPA claims and should not distribute until the 6-month period expires (or earlier, with consent/knowledge of potential claimants).",

          "A": "This is incorrect because the 6-month limit runs from the grant, not from death. The notes clearly state: '6 months from the date on which representation... is first taken out' - 'representation' means the grant (probate or LA). Death and grant often occur months apart (grant can take 2-6 months or more after death to obtain). If the limit ran from death, this would give dependents less practical time to apply (need to wait for grant to know the estate's composition, but time runs from earlier death date). Running time from grant gives dependents a clear 6-month window after the grant is extracted. The answer incorrectly uses death as the starting point.",

The question states the grant was '6 months ago' and she applies 'now' - this is ambiguous about whether 'now' is at the 6-month mark or within it. If the limit is 'no later than 6 months from the grant,' applying at the 6-month anniversary should be timely (up to and including that date). However, if the grant was exactly 6 months ago and she applies 'now' (after the 6-month anniversary, even by one day), she would be late. The question's wording suggests she is applying right at the limit, which should be timely. Answer C is clearer that she is within time.",

While s 5(2) MPA does not explicitly list the parent's past conduct toward children, it states: 'the Tribunal must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including (but not limited to) the following matters' - 'but not limited to' indicates the list is not exhaustive. The Tribunal can consider any relevant circumstances. Furthermore, 'just and equitable' in s 5(1) requires a broad assessment of fairness. A parent who abused children might receive: (1) no maintenance (if the abuse was severe and the Tribunal finds it unjust to order payment), (2) reduced maintenance (some filial duty remains despite abuse, but less than for a loving parent), or (3) full maintenance (if the children have forgiven, or the parent's basic needs outweigh the past wrongs). The notes do not provide specific guidance, but the 'just and equitable' standard allows the Tribunal to balance the parent's current needs against the children's history of suffering. This is highly fact-specific and discretionary.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is too absolute. While severe abuse might justify refusing maintenance in some cases, there is no blanket rule barring all abusive parents. Section 5(1) requires assessment of whether maintenance is 'just and equitable' considering all circumstances. The Tribunal has discretion. Factors might include: severity of abuse, how long ago it occurred, whether the parent has shown remorse, whether the parent's current destitution outweighs past wrongs, the children's current relationship with the parent, and the parent's vulnerability. Complete refusal is one possible outcome, but not mandatory. The MPA does not create categorical bars based on past conduct. The answer incorrectly mandates dismissal.",

While the parent's financial needs (s 5(2)(a)) and the child's financial ability (s 5(2)(d)) are relevant, s 5(1) requires that it be 'just and equitable' to order maintenance. Requiring children to financially support a parent who abused them might not be 'just and equitable' even if the parent has financial need and the children have financial ability. Section 5(2) states the Tribunal considers 'all the circumstances of the case including (but not limited to)' the listed factors - the 'but not limited to' language allows consideration of abuse history. The answer incorrectly limits analysis to financial factors.",

However, the MPA does not impose such a limitation. If the abuse was severe enough (e.g., attempted murder, prolonged torture, causing permanent disability), the Tribunal might find it just and equitable to refuse maintenance based solely on the abuse, without needing additional grounds. The 'just and equitable' standard is broad and discretionary. The Tribunal is not required to find multiple grounds - one sufficient ground (like extreme abuse) might justify refusal. The answer invents a 'cannot be sole ground' limitation that restricts the Tribunal's discretion unnecessarily."

Rule 3 provides: 'Subject to the rights of the surviving spouse, if any, the estate... shall be distributed by equal portions per stirpes to and amongst the children of the person dying intestate.' Here, the deceased left a surviving spouse (second wife) and issue (daughter). The daughter is 'issue' of the deceased regardless of which marriage she is from. Under Rule 2, the spouse gets one-half ($400,000). Under Rule 3, the issue (daughter) gets the remaining half ($400,000). The fact that the daughter is from a different marriage than the surviving spouse is irrelevant - all children of the deceased are treated equally as 'issue.' If there were multiple children, they would share the 50% issue portion. Here, with only one child, she gets the full 50%. Total: second wife $400K, daughter $400K.",

ISA focuses on relationship to the deceased, not to the surviving spouse. If only children of the surviving spouse could inherit, children from previous marriages would be disinherited, creating harsh and unfair results. ISA treats all children of the deceased equally. The answer incorrectly limits inheritance to children of the surviving spouse.",

Rule 3 gives the issue (daughter) the other 50%. They do not 'share equally under Rule 2' - rather, Rule 2 allocates to spouse and Rule 3 allocates to issue, with both getting 50%. The distinction matters for understanding the statutory structure. If there were multiple children, Rule 3 would subdivide the 50% among them, but the spouse's 50% under Rule 2 would be unchanged.

Section 2 IFPA's definition of dependents includes 'son and daughter,' and the notes clarify this includes adopted children. The policy is that adopted children are treated equally with biological children for all purposes, including succession and family provision. Having been legally adopted, the son has the same status as a biological son. He can apply under IFPA as a dependent. Whether he should receive maintenance depends on the s 3(1) assessment (whether the will makes reasonable provision for his maintenance), considering factors like his financial needs, income, the deceased's reasons for excluding him, etc. But he has standing to apply. The adoption gives him full status as 'son' for IFPA purposes.",

If two dependents apply (one biological, one adopted), the court does not automatically prefer the biological child. The assessment is based on maintenance needs, not biological vs. adopted status. If the adopted child has greater needs or less income, he might receive more than a biological child. The answer invents a priority that does not exist in IFPA.",

Similarly, for IFPA, adopted children are 'son and daughter' by virtue of being adopted, without needing the adoption order to specifically address IFPA.

Both provisions allow posthumous children (conceived before death, born after death) to claim. The requirement is that the child was conceived before the deceased's death and is subsequently born alive. Here, the daughter was pregnant when the deceased died (child was en ventre sa mere), and the child was born alive three months later.

The policy is that upon remarriage, the new spouse assumes responsibility for support. The deceased's estate no longer needs to provide maintenance because the new spouse should provide. Here, the daughter/widow (she was the deceased's wife - the question says 'deceased's daughter' but the remarriage triggering s 3(2)(a) suggests she is actually the widow) remarried. Wait, I'm confused. Let me reread. 'Deceased's daughter receive $1,000 monthly. The daughter later remarries.' So she is the deceased's daughter (child), not widow. Then s 3(2)(a) about 'wife or husband' doesn't apply to her. Section 3(2)(b) applies: 'in the case of a daughter who has not been married, or who is under disability, her marriage or the cesser of her disability, whichever is the later.'

The bright-line rule (marriage = termination) avoids this. If the daughter's new marriage ends in divorce or widowhood and she needs maintenance, she might seek support from the new spouse (divorce maintenance) or make a fresh IFPA application if another family member subsequently dies.

Selling the house would: (1) displace the widow from her home, causing hardship, (2) potentially force a rushed sale at poor price, (3) generate capital that needs reinvestment, creating costs and risks. However, if the son has genuine maintenance needs that cannot be met from the existing $50,000 annual income and $1M cash, the court might need to consider sale. The court balances: widow's housing needs vs. son's maintenance needs, availability of alternatives (Can the son's needs be met from income/cash without selling? Can the widow relocate?), and whether sale is improvident overall. This is highly fact-specific.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is too simplistic and does not engage with the 'improvident' analysis. While it is true that if the son's maintenance cannot be provided from existing income/cash and requires sale proceeds, sale might be ordered, the court must still assess whether such sale would be 'improvident.' Section 3(5) prohibits improvident realization. Selling the family home to provide maintenance for one dependent while displacing another dependent (widow) might be improvident. The court must consider whether there are less drastic alternatives (using the $1M cash, restricting the son's maintenance to what can be provided from existing income, etc.). The answer does not consider these nuances.",
          "B": "This is too absolute in the opposite direction. While selling the family home where the widow lives would often be improvident, s 3(5) does not create an absolute prohibition. The court must consider 'the interests of the deceased's dependants' - this is plural, including both the widow and the son. If the son has dire maintenance needs (e.g., disabled, no income, urgent medical expenses) that cannot be met except by selling the house, and the widow could reasonably relocate to smaller accommodation, sale might not be improvident. The analysis is fact-specific, not a blanket prohibition. The answer incorrectly creates an absolute rule protecting the house.",
          "C": "While using sale proceeds to invest in income-generating assets is a possible strategy, the answer does not address the improvidence analysis. Section 3(5) asks whether the realization (sale) would be improvident. Selling the family home (displacing the widow) to invest proceeds for the son's benefit might be improvident. Furthermore, the notes from APZ v AQA suggest the court works with existing income, not with income that could theoretically be generated by restructuring the estate. Ordering sale to reinvest for higher income introduces uncertainty and risk. The answer suggests a strategy without analyzing whether it satisfies s 3(5)."

ISA creates a hierarchy where descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) take priority over ascendants (parents, grandparents). Rule 3 provides: 'the estate... shall be distributed by equal portions per stirpes to and amongst the children of the person dying intestate' (when there is no spouse or spouse has taken their share). Rule 5 provides: 'If there are no descendants the parent or parents of the intestate shall take the estate.' The word 'If there are no descendants' in Rule 5 is a condition - parents only inherit when there are NO descendants. Here, there are descendants (two children). Rule 3 applies, giving the entire estate to the children ($800K ÷ 2 = $400K each if estate is $800K, or whatever the estate is divided by 2). Rule 5 does not apply because descendants exist. The mother receives nothing. While this may seem harsh (elderly mother gets nothing while adult children inherit), ISA's policy is that inheritance flows downward (to descendants) preferentially over upward (to ascendants) or sideways (to siblings).",

If equal division among all relatives were the rule, the nine ISA Rules would be unnecessary - there would be one rule: 'divide among all living relatives equally.'

Section 3(2) allows 'approved person or organisation in whose care a parent resides' to apply. A nursing home caring for the parent would qualify if it is an 'approved' organization (likely approved by relevant government authorities). The nursing home can apply for maintenance to be paid to the nursing home (not to the parent) to cover the costs of caring for the parent. This makes practical sense: if the parent is incapacitated and in a nursing home, direct payment to the nursing home ensures the funds go to the parent's care rather than being potentially misused. However, the notes also state: 'Where the parent ceases to be in the care of the approved person or organisation, any part of the monthly allowance... remaining, after deducting the reasonable costs and expenses of maintaining the parent, must be held in trust for the parent' (s 3(4)) - protecting the parent if they leave the nursing home.",

In fact, it may be preferable for the nursing home to apply: (1) the nursing home knows the exact costs of care, (2) direct payment to nursing home ensures funds go to care, (3) family members might not apply (estranged from parent, unaware of need, etc.). If the nursing home had to wait for family, parents in nursing homes might not get support. The answer incorrectly requires family member involvement.",

Authorization is relevant under s 11(1)(c) for applications by 'any other person whom the parent has authorised,' but nursing homes apply under s 3(2) or s 11(1)(b) ('any person in whose care the parent resides'), neither of which requires authorization.

Rule 7 applies only 'if there are no... brothers and sisters or children of such brothers and sisters.' Here, there are no brothers and sisters (deceased's siblings predeceased), but there ARE 'children of such brothers and sisters' (niece and nephew). These fall under Rule 6.

The mother might need more than the $800 rent (which only covers housing, not food, medical, etc.).

The daughter's physical disability affecting her ability to work is highly relevant to her 'past, present or future... income' (none, due to disability). It is also 'any other matter... relevant' to her maintenance needs. A disabled daughter who cannot work has greater maintenance needs than financially independent siblings who can support themselves.

This explicitly recognizes that children's financial circumstances affect their ability to pay. Equal amounts from children with unequal incomes would be inequitable. The unemployed child cannot pay (has no income for own requirements). The low-income child can pay only a small amount. The high-income child can pay more. Section 5(1) requires 'just and equitable,' which implies differential treatment based on ability. While filial duty applies to all children equally in moral terms, the practical implementation (how much each pays) must reflect financial realities. The answer incorrectly mandates equal amounts despite unequal abilities.",
          "C": "This is too extreme in the opposite direction. While the child earning $10,000 has the greatest ability to pay and might pay the largest share, the child earning $3,000 might also be able to contribute something (perhaps $100-200 monthly). Section 5(1) requires assessing whether each child 'is able to provide maintenance... after the respondent's own requirements... have been supplied.' With $3,000 income, after own/family needs (perhaps $2,500), the child might have $500 available, some of which could go to the father. The Tribunal should not let the high-income child bear the entire burden if other children can also contribute. This would be unfair to the high-income child. The answer incorrectly excludes moderate-income children from contributing.",
          "D": "While the Tribunal might not order the unemployed child to pay currently (no income means no ability to pay per s 5(1)(a)), this is not about 'excusing' them temporarily pending employment - rather, the Tribunal should not make an order against them at all if they cannot pay. If the unemployed child later becomes employed, the father could apply to add that child to the order or seek a new/varied order. But the initial order should only be against children who can currently pay. Furthermore, requiring equal amounts 'with excuse for one child' is not how MPA works - the Tribunal apportions based on ability, not equal amounts with excuses. The answer incorrectly assumes equal amounts are the starting point."

        "B": "Yes, but any maintenance ordered will terminate upon her remarriage.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "She can apply, but payments will terminate on remarriage. Section 3(2)(a) IFPA provides that periodical payments 'will terminate no later than — (a) in the case of a wife or husband, her or his remarriage.' This addresses when payments terminate, not whether the widow can apply in the first place. A widow who has remarried can still apply under IFPA (assuming she is within the 6-month limit from grant, which she is at 5 months). The court will assess whether the will makes reasonable provision for her maintenance (s 3(1)). However, if the court orders periodical payments, those payments will terminate upon remarriage per s 3(2)(a). Here, the widow already remarried before applying. If the court orders periodical payments, the termination is immediate (she already remarried). This makes periodical payments pointless. The court might refuse to order anything (the widow has a new spouse who should support her), or if the estate is under $50,000, might order a lump sum under s 3(4) (which would not terminate on remarriage since it's paid immediately). Most likely, the court refuses the application on the merits (the new spouse should provide maintenance).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is too absolute. While remarriage affects the termination of payments (s 3(2)(a)), it does not bar the application itself. A remarried widow can theoretically apply, though the application will likely fail on the merits (she has a new spouse who should support her, so she likely does not need maintenance from the deceased's estate). Furthermore, if the estate is under $50,000, she could seek a lump sum under s 3(4), which would not terminate on remarriage (lump sums are paid immediately, so remarriage is irrelevant). The answer incorrectly treats remarriage as an absolute bar on applications when it is a termination event for periodical payments.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the timing of remarriage (before or after grant) is irrelevant to the s 3(2)(a) termination rule. Section 3(2)(a) states periodical payments terminate upon remarriage, whenever that occurs. If the widow remarries before the grant (as here), before applying, before the order is made, or after the order is made, the effect is the same - any periodical payments terminate on remarriage. The grant date is relevant to the 6-month limitation (s 4(1)), not to the remarriage termination. Here, the widow can apply (within 6 months of grant), but if periodical payments are ordered, they terminate immediately (she already remarried). The answer invents a distinction based on remarriage timing relative to grant.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there is no one-year or other temporal bar on applications by remarried widows. Section 3(2)(a) addresses termination of payments, not timing of applications. A widow can apply under IFPA regardless of when she remarried (immediately after death, months later, years later), as long as she is within the 6-month limitation from grant (s 4(1)). The issue is not whether she can apply, but whether the court will order maintenance (probably not, given the new spouse should support her) and if so, whether periodical payments make sense (they terminate immediately on remarriage). The answer invents a one-year application bar."

      "question": "Section 5(2) IFPA requires the court to set aside a portion of the estate 'sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision.' The court orders $2,000 monthly ($24,000 annually) for the dependent daughter. The estate generates 4% annual return. What portion should be set aside?",

        "A": "$24,000, the annual maintenance amount.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The court should set aside $600,000 to generate the required income. The notes state: 's5(2) IFPA: \"The court may give such consequential directions as it thinks fit for the purpose of giving effect to an order made under this Act, but no larger part of the net estate shall be set aside or appropriated to answer by the income thereof the provision for maintenance thereby made than such a part as, at the date of the order, is sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision.\"' This means the court calculates: what capital is needed to generate the ordered income? If $24,000 annually is ordered, and the estate generates 4% return, then $24,000 ÷ 0.04 = $600,000 must be set aside. This $600,000, invested at 4%, produces $24,000 annual income for the daughter's maintenance. The key phrase is 'no larger part... shall be set aside... than such a part as... is sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision.' The court sets aside exactly enough capital to generate the income, no more. This protects other beneficiaries (they receive the remaining $400,000 if the estate is $1M, or whatever remains after the $600K is set aside).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This incorrectly treats the annual maintenance amount ($24,000) as the capital to be set aside. But $24,000 capital would generate only $960 annual income at 4% ($24,000 × 4% = $960), which is far less than the required $24,000 annually. The daughter would receive only $80 monthly instead of $2,000 monthly. Section 5(2) requires setting aside capital 'sufficient to produce by the income thereof' the maintenance amount. This means capital × rate of return = annual maintenance. Here, capital × 4% = $24,000, so capital = $24,000 ÷ 4% = $600,000. The answer conflates annual income with capital needed to generate that income.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because $100,000 at 4% produces only $4,000 annually ($333 monthly), far below the ordered $2,000 monthly ($24,000 annually). The daughter would be drastically under-provided. Section 5(2) requires setting aside a part 'sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision' - $100,000 is insufficient. The reference to 'capital appreciation' is also incorrect - s 5(2) focuses on income (dividends, interest, rent), not capital appreciation (increase in asset value). Capital appreciation is uncertain and cannot be relied upon for maintenance. The court must set aside enough capital so that its income (at current rates) produces the required maintenance. The answer drastically underfunds the maintenance.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because s 5(2) prohibits setting aside more than necessary. The section states: 'no larger part of the net estate shall be set aside... than such a part as... is sufficient to produce by the income thereof the amount of the said provision.' If the entire estate is $1 million and only $600,000 is needed to generate $24,000 annually, setting aside the entire $1M would violate this prohibition. The remaining $400,000 should go to the estate's beneficiaries (business partner per the will), subject to the maintenance variation. Over-setting aside would create a legacy for the daughter (she'd eventually get the excess capital), not just maintenance. The answer violates the 'no larger part' rule."
