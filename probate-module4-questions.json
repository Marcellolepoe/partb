      "question": "Testator's will appoints his brother as executor. The brother is an undischarged bankrupt. Can the brother apply for and be granted probate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes, because he is named in the will and testator's intention must be respected.",
        "B": "No, under section 400 IRDA undischarged bankrupts cannot be executors or administrators.",
        "C": "Yes, but only if he applies to court for leave, which may be granted in exceptional circumstances.",
        "D": "No, unless he obtains consent from all beneficiaries under the will."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The brother can apply for leave of court, which might be granted in exceptional circumstances. The notes state: 'Undischarged bankrupts CANNOT be executors or administrators (s 400 IRDA) – due to lack of financial prudence. Can apply to court but will only be granted in very exceptional circumstances – but executor is more likely to gain leave of court since he was explicitly indicated by testator in the will.' Section 400 IRDA creates a general prohibition: bankrupts cannot be executors/administrators because they lack financial prudence (having proven unable to manage their own affairs). However, the prohibition is not absolute. The court has discretion to grant leave in exceptional circumstances. The notes indicate an executor (named in the will) is MORE likely to gain leave than an administrator (not named, just applying under statutory priority). Why? Because the testator explicitly chose this person as executor, expressing trust and confidence in him despite the bankruptcy. The court respects testamentary freedom. Exceptional circumstances might include: (1) the executor has since arranged a payment plan and is managing finances better, (2) the estate is simple and low-risk, (3) there are co-executors who are financially sound, (4) all beneficiaries consent. Without leave, the brother cannot be granted probate. With leave, he can.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it ignores s 400 IRDA, which prohibits undischarged bankrupts from being executors/administrators. Testamentary freedom is important, but it is not absolute – statutes impose limits. The testator cannot override a statutory disqualification simply by naming someone in the will. If the testator names an infant (under 21), the infant cannot be granted probate until reaching age 21 (s 21(1) PAA) – the testator's intention doesn't override this. Similarly, if the testator names a lunatic, they cannot be granted probate (s 22 PAA). The same applies to undischarged bankrupts (s 400 IRDA). However, the answer is too absolute in saying the brother can obtain probate automatically. He must first apply for leave of court, which might be granted in exceptional circumstances. The answer incorrectly treats testamentary intention as overriding statutory disqualification.",
          "B": "This is too absolute. While s 400 IRDA prohibits undischarged bankrupts from being executors/administrators, the notes clarify: 'Can apply to court but will only be granted in very exceptional circumstances – but executor is more likely to gain leave of court since he was explicitly indicated by testator in the will.' The prohibition is not absolute – it is subject to the court's discretion to grant leave. If the court grants leave, the bankrupt can be appointed. The answer incorrectly states a categorical prohibition when the law allows for discretionary exceptions. This is similar to how a minor cannot be granted probate (s 21(1) PAA) until reaching 21 – the prohibition is absolute. But the bankruptcy disqualification is subject to leave.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because beneficiary consent is not the test for overriding s 400 IRDA. The notes state the court can grant leave 'in very exceptional circumstances,' and that executors (named in will) are more likely to gain leave. The test is whether there are exceptional circumstances justifying the appointment despite the bankruptcy – not whether beneficiaries consent. Beneficiary consent might be a factor supporting the application (showing the interested parties don't object), but it is not determinative. The court assesses: (1) risk to the estate (is the executor likely to mismanage?), (2) testator's intention (explicitly named), (3) alternatives (are there other capable executors/administrators?), (4) estate complexity, (5) executor's conduct since bankruptcy. Consent is relevant but not the sole criterion. The answer invents a consent requirement."

      "question": "Deceased died intestate. The beneficiaries under ISA are: (1) surviving spouse, (2) two adult children. The spouse wants to apply for Letters of Administration. Must the spouse obtain renunciations from the two children before the court grants LA?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Yes, the court requires renunciation from all persons with equal or higher priority under section 18(4) PAA.",
        "B": "No, renunciation is only required from those with higher priority, not the same class.",
        "C": "Yes, unless the spouse can prove the children are unreachable or unwilling to cooperate.",
        "D": "No, the spouse can apply jointly with the children without requiring renunciations."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Renunciation is only required from those with higher priority, not the same class. The notes state: 'Not necessary to obtain renunciations from parties within the same class of priority (Estate of Tan Hui Cheng).' Section 18(4) PAA sets priority for intestacy grants: (a) surviving spouse, (b) children, (c) parents, (d) siblings, etc. Here, the deceased died intestate leaving spouse and children. Under s 18(4)(a), the spouse has priority. Under s 18(4)(b), the children have the next priority. The spouse and children are in DIFFERENT classes (spouse is class (a), children are class (b)). The spouse has HIGHER priority than the children. Therefore, the spouse does NOT need renunciations from the children (who are in a lower class). The spouse can apply alone. However, if there were two surviving spouses (e.g., polygamous marriage recognized under Muslim law, hypothetically), they would be in the SAME class (both s 18(4)(a)), and Estate of Tan Hui Cheng indicates renunciations within the same class are not necessary – they could apply jointly or one could apply without the other renouncing. Here, spouse is higher priority than children, so no renunciation needed from children.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it requires renunciation from those with 'equal or higher priority,' but the notes clarify: 'Not necessary to obtain renunciations from parties within the same class of priority (Estate of Tan Hui Cheng).' If renunciation were required from equal priority (same class), then in a case with two surviving children both wanting to be administrators, each would need renunciation from the other – an absurdity. The law allows multiple administrators from the same class to apply jointly. Section 6(1) PAA allows up to 4 administrators. If both children wanted to apply, they could apply jointly without renouncing. And if one child wanted to apply, Estate of Tan Hui Cheng indicates no renunciation needed from the other child (same class). Renunciation is required from HIGHER priority classes if the applicant is from a lower class (e.g., a child applying must get renunciation from surviving spouse). Here, spouse is HIGHER priority than children, so spouse needs no renunciation from children. The answer incorrectly extends the renunciation requirement to the same class.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it creates exceptions ('children unreachable or unwilling') that don't apply here. The notes state: 'Prior rights in intestacy: Court will require renunciation from those with higher priority under s 18(4) PAA (Toh Seok Kheng, [26]) --> if those with higher priority are unwilling to renounce, then need to lodge a citation against them.' This applies when the applicant is from a LOWER priority class and those in HIGHER classes won't renounce. Here, the spouse is HIGHER priority than the children. The spouse doesn't need renunciation from lower-priority children. The exception (citation for unwilling higher-priority parties) doesn't apply. The answer invents a requirement and exceptions that are legally unnecessary.",
          "D": "This is partially correct but misleading. The spouse CAN apply alone without renunciations from the children (because spouse has higher priority). However, the answer suggests the spouse 'can apply jointly with the children without requiring renunciations,' which is true but obscures the key point: the spouse doesn't need the children's involvement at all. The spouse can apply alone, or the spouse and children can apply jointly (up to 4 administrators under s 6(1) PAA), but neither scenario requires renunciations. The answer is not wrong, but it doesn't clearly state the legal principle: renunciation is only required from higher priority classes (or if unwilling, citation). Here, children are lower priority, so no renunciation needed. The answer is less precise than the correct answer."

      "question": "Deceased's will appoints two executors, Andrew and Beatrice. Andrew extracts probate and begins administering the estate. Without Beatrice's knowledge, Andrew sells a property belonging to the estate to a third party. Is the sale valid and binding on the estate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "No, both executors must act jointly for the sale to bind the estate.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The sale is valid and binds the estate. The notes state: 'Tacplas Property Services v Lee Peter Michael: Executors can act jointly and severally, and the acts of one executor could bind the estate and the other executors. But administrators of an estate MUST act jointly and the act of one administrator cannot bind the estate, unless that act was ratified by all administrators.' This is a critical distinction: EXECUTORS act jointly and severally (each can bind the estate independently), but ADMINISTRATORS must act jointly (all must agree). Why the difference? Executors are chosen by the testator, who places trust in each individually. The testator's confidence in each executor allows them to act severally. Administrators are appointed by statute (not chosen by the deceased), so the law requires them to act jointly for protection. Here, Andrew and Beatrice are executors. Andrew sold estate property. Under Tacplas, Andrew's act binds the estate and Beatrice, even though Beatrice didn't know or consent. The third-party buyer receives good title. Beatrice might have a claim against Andrew for breach of fiduciary duty (if the sale was improvident or Andrew profited), but the sale itself is valid. The estate is bound.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because it conflates the rules for executors and administrators. The notes distinguish: 'Executors can act jointly and severally... But administrators of an estate MUST act jointly.' If Andrew and Beatrice were administrators (e.g., applying for LA because no executor was appointed), then they would need to act jointly, and Andrew's unilateral sale would NOT bind the estate (unless Beatrice ratified it). But here, Andrew and Beatrice are executors. Executors can act severally – each executor's act binds the estate. The answer incorrectly applies the joint-action requirement (for administrators) to executors.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because ratification is required for administrators, not executors. The notes state: 'administrators... MUST act jointly and the act of one administrator cannot bind the estate, unless that act was ratified by all administrators.' If Andrew and Beatrice were administrators, Andrew's unilateral sale would be void unless Beatrice ratified it. But they are executors, not administrators. Executors act severally – Andrew's sale is immediately binding, no ratification needed. Beatrice might later sue Andrew for breach of fiduciary duty (if the sale harmed the estate or beneficiaries), but the sale itself is valid ab initio. The answer incorrectly applies the ratification rule (for administrators) to executors.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because it invents a 'fair market value' condition. The notes from Tacplas state executors can act severally, binding the estate, without qualification. Andrew's sale is valid regardless of price. If Andrew sold the property at undervalue (or to himself, creating a conflict of interest), Beatrice and the beneficiaries might have a claim against Andrew for breach of fiduciary duty, and might seek to set aside the sale on grounds of fraud or self-dealing. But as a general rule, the sale is binding. The 'fair market value' condition is not part of the Tacplas principle. The answer creates a requirement that doesn't exist."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Letters of Administration with Will Annexed should be granted. The notes state: 'Where there is no executor who can or does appear and extract probate, letters of administration with the will annexed may be granted to such person(s) the court considers the fittest (s 13(1) PAA). Prior right to a grant under (1) ranks in the following order (s 13(2) PAA): (a) a universal or residuary legatee... (b) a legal personal representative of a deceased universal or residuary legatee; (c) such person or persons, being beneficiaries under the will, as would have been entitled to a grant of letters of administration if the deceased had died intestate; (d) a legatee having a beneficial interest; (e) a creditor of the deceased.' Here, all three executors renounced. Under s 13(1), LA with will annexed is available. Under s 13(2)(a), the residuary legatee has first priority. The grant is 'with will annexed' because there IS a will (just no executor willing to act). The administrator administers the estate according to the will's terms. This differs from ordinary LA (for intestacy, no will).",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "'Letters of Administration' (LA) without qualification typically refers to intestacy grants where there is NO will. The notes distinguish: 'If there is a will and executor' (probate), 'If there is no will' (LA), and the scenario where 'there is no executor who can or does appear' (LA with will annexed under s 13). Here, there IS a will, but no executor willing to act. The correct grant is 'Letters of Administration with Will Annexed' (s 13(1) PAA), not ordinary LA. The difference matters: LA with will annexed means the administrator distributes according to the will's terms. Ordinary LA (intestacy) means distribution under ISA rules. The answer uses the wrong terminology, suggesting intestacy rules apply when the will should govern.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because it ignores the statutory priority under s 13(2) PAA. The court doesn't have unfettered discretion to appoint any administrator. Section 13(2) creates a ranking: (a) residuary legatee, (b) representative of deceased residuary legatee, (c) beneficiaries who would inherit under intestacy, (d) other legatees, (e) creditors. The court must follow this priority. The residuary legatee has first claim. Only if the residuary legatee renounces or is unavailable does the court move to the next class. And the will is not ignored – the administrator administers according to the will (it's LA 'with will annexed'). The answer incorrectly suggests the court disregards the will and appoints arbitrarily.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because renunciation of probate precludes the executors from obtaining a grant. The notes state: 'Effect of Renunciation of probate: (1) precludes person from applying for grant, (2) but court can allow person to withdraw renunciation for benefit of estate or interested persons (s 5 PAA).' Once the executors renounce, they cannot apply for probate. The beneficiaries cannot force them to accept the role. Probate is a grant to executors named in the will. If all executors renounce, probate cannot issue. Instead, LA with will annexed issues to the next-priority person under s 13(2). The answer incorrectly suggests beneficiaries can obtain probate, but probate is specifically for executors."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The caveat prevents the grant for six months. The notes from WKR v WKQ state: 'A person interested who wishes to oppose the resealing of the grant may file a caveat (s 33 of the PAA, r 239(1) of the FJR). Once filed, the caveat remains in force for six months and operates to prevent the making of a grant by the Registrar (rr 239(3) to 239(5) of the FJR).' This applies to any grant (probate, LA, resealing). When a caveat is filed, it creates a 'freeze' – the Registrar cannot issue the grant for six months. This gives the caveator time to investigate, gather evidence, and potentially challenge the grant. Here, the daughter filed a caveat on 3 March claiming the will is invalid. From 3 March, the Registrar cannot issue probate for six months (until approximately 3 September 2025). During this period, the applicant can: (1) do nothing and wait for the caveat to expire, (2) issue a warning to the caveator requiring her to state her interest and commence a probate action if she wishes to pursue the challenge. If the caveator doesn't respond or commence action, the caveat lapses after six months and the grant can proceed.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because the timing of the OS filing doesn't prevent the caveat's effect. The notes state: 'Once filed, the caveat... operates to prevent the making of a grant by the Registrar.' The caveat prevents the grant regardless of when the OS was filed. Even if the OS was filed first, a caveat filed afterward still freezes the grant process. The caveat protects interested persons who might not know about the application or need time to investigate. If the rule were 'first to file wins,' an applicant could rush through a grant before interested parties learned of the death or could respond. The caveat system prevents this. The answer incorrectly applies a 'first in time' priority that doesn't exist.",
          "C": "This is too strong. The caveat doesn't require the applicant to withdraw or file a contentious action. The notes explain the process: 'After a caveat has been lodged, any person interested may issue the caveator a warning which requires the caveator to state his interest and give particulars of any contrary interest... On such warning being served on him, the caveator must enter an appearance and file and serve a summons for directions... Upon issuance of the summons for directions, the matter shall be deemed to be contested... The contested matter must then be referred to a Judge who may dispose of the matter in a summary manner, or direct that the matter proceeds to trial... If the court directs that the matter proceeds to trial, a 'probate action' will be deemed to have been commenced.' So the applicant can issue a warning to the caveator, forcing the caveator to either pursue the challenge or back down. Only if the caveator files a summons for directions and the court directs trial does a probate action commence. The applicant doesn't automatically have to file anything – they can wait out the six months. The answer incorrectly makes the contentious action mandatory.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because a caveat doesn't invalidate the will. The notes state the caveat 'operates to prevent the making of a grant' – it's procedural, not substantive. Filing a caveat doesn't determine will validity; it just freezes the grant process while the caveator investigates or challenges. The daughter claims the will is invalid, but that's just an allegation. To actually invalidate the will, she must: (1) respond to a warning (if issued), (2) file a summons for directions, (3) have the matter proceed to trial (if the judge doesn't dispose summarily), (4) prove at trial that the will is invalid (e.g., lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence, lack of proper execution). Only if the court finds the will invalid is it set aside. The caveat itself doesn't make that determination. The answer conflates procedural (caveat) with substantive (will validity)."

This adds to the cost for LA proceedings.' And: 'if there is a minor (below 21) who is a beneficiary or a life interest under the deceased's estate, need at least 2 administrators for the estate (s 6(2) PAA).' Why these requirements? (1) Sureties/bond: Minors cannot protect their own interests, so the law requires financial security (sureties guarantee proper administration). If the administrator mismanages the estate, the sureties compensate the minors. The applicant can apply for dispensation of sureties (court order waiving the requirement), but this requires a separate application, affidavit, and court approval. (2) Two administrators: Section 6(2) PAA requires minimum two administrators when there's a minor beneficiary or life interest. This provides oversight – two administrators check each other, reducing risk of mismanagement or fraud. One administrator alone might act against the minor's interests; two are less likely to collude.

These are significant practical and cost requirements. The sureties requirement adds cost and complexity (finding people willing to be sureties, oath fees, bond fees, or the cost of applying for dispensation).

'De bonis non' means 'of the goods not [yet administered].' When an administrator dies mid-administration, their authority ceases. The original grant of LA was personal to them and doesn't transfer to their estate or executor. The partially administered estate is in limbo – no one has legal authority to continue. The beneficiaries must apply for a new grant (de bonis non) to appoint a new administrator to complete the work. The new administrator steps into the shoes of the deceased administrator, taking over the unadministered assets, paying remaining debts, and distributing to beneficiaries. This is a fresh court application, requiring a new originating summons, affidavits, etc. It adds cost and delay. This problem illustrates why appointing multiple administrators (if possible) is prudent – if one dies, the other(s) can continue. But administrators must act jointly, so even with multiple administrators, all must cooperate.",

Beneficiaries have an equitable interest in the estate but no legal authority to act unless they obtain a grant. If beneficiaries attempted to collect assets or make distributions without a grant, third parties (banks, land registry, etc.) would refuse to deal with them.

And: 'Affidavit of foreign law must be filed by any person who practices or has practiced in that jurisdiction to provide evidence of law on application for a grant (FJCPD para 65).' Section 5 Wills Act provides that a will is formally valid if executed according to: (1) the law of the place where executed (lex loci), (2) the law of the testator's domicile at execution or death (lex domicilii), or (3) the law of the testator's nationality. Here, the will was executed in France and complies with French law. Under s 5, it should be formally valid in Singapore. But the Singapore court needs PROOF that the will complied with French law. The Affidavit of Foreign Law (sworn by a French lawyer or someone qualified in French law) states: 'Under French law, a will is validly executed if [requirements]. This will meets those requirements.' This establishes formal validity. The court can then admit the will to probate.",

This applies when the will purports to comply with Singapore law (s 6 WA) but there's doubt (e.g., no attestation clause, witnesses unclear, etc.). Here, the will was executed in France under French law. The Affidavit of Due Execution (from Singapore witnesses) is irrelevant. Instead, an Affidavit of Foreign Law (from a French lawyer) is needed to prove the will complies with French law, which s 5 WA recognizes. The answer confuses domestic and foreign execution issues.",

So if the will is in French, a certified translation is required. But translation is a separate issue from validity. Translation allows the court to read the will; it doesn't prove the will was validly executed. The executor must file BOTH a translation (if needed) AND an Affidavit of Foreign Law (to prove formal validity under French law per s 5 WA). The answer incorrectly treats translation as sufficient for validation.",

Section 5 creates a choice-of-law rule: a will is valid if executed per lex loci, lex domicilii, or lex patriae. But the court doesn't automatically know what French law requires or whether this will complied. The executor must file an Affidavit of Foreign Law (from a French lawyer) stating: 'French law requires X, Y, Z for valid execution. This will meets those requirements.' This proves formal validity.

        "correct": "Resealing is possible but requires proving Australian domicile. The notes from WKR v WKQ state: 'It is undisputed that Vanuatu is a Commonwealth jurisdiction, and that the Vanuatu Grant falls under s 47(1)(a) of the PAA. Pursuant to s 47(4) of the PAA, the court, in granting a resealing application, must first determine the issue of the deceased's domicile. If it appears that the deceased person is not domiciled in the jurisdiction where the foreign court had issued the grant, the court should not reseal the grant, unless the grant is one that would have been made by the Singapore courts.' Section 47(1)(a) PAA allows resealing of Commonwealth grants. Australia is a Commonwealth jurisdiction, so s 47(1)(a) applies. However, s 47(4) requires the deceased to have been domiciled in the jurisdiction that issued the grant (Australia). Here, the facts state the deceased was domiciled in Australia, so the domicile requirement is met. The executor can apply to reseal the Australian grant. The Singapore court will issue an order that the Australian grant is sealed and has effect in Singapore, allowing the executor to administer the Singapore assets. If the deceased was NOT domiciled in Australia, resealing would be refused unless the Australian grant is one the Singapore court would have made.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is correct as far as it goes but incomplete. Section 47(1)(a) PAA allows resealing of grants from Commonwealth jurisdictions, and Australia is a Commonwealth jurisdiction. But the answer omits a critical requirement: s 47(4) requires the deceased to have been domiciled in the jurisdiction where the grant was issued. The notes from WKR v WKQ state: 'the court, in granting a resealing application, must first determine the issue of the deceased's domicile. If it appears that the deceased person is not domiciled in the jurisdiction where the foreign court had issued the grant, the court should not reseal the grant, unless the grant is one that would have been made by the Singapore courts.' So Commonwealth jurisdiction is necessary but not sufficient – domicile must also be proven. Answer C is more precise.",
          "B": "This is incorrect because resealing is available, avoiding the need for a fresh grant. The notes explain: 'Resealing of foreign grant by SG court – deceased must be domiciled in the jurisdiction where the grant was issued (e.g. Vanuatu).' Resealing is a streamlined process: the executor files an ex parte originating summons with the foreign grant and evidence of domicile. The Singapore court issues an order resealing the foreign grant, giving it effect in Singapore. This is faster and cheaper than a fresh probate application. The executor doesn't need to re-prove the will, re-swear affidavits, etc. If the deceased was domiciled in Australia and Australia is a Commonwealth jurisdiction, resealing is available. The answer incorrectly requires a fresh grant.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because resealing is not automatic. The notes from WKR v WKQ state: 'A person who wishes to reseal a Commonwealth grant may apply to do so by an ex parte originating summons. Such a person must show evidence that the deceased was domiciled in the jurisdiction of the grant sought to be resealed (s 47 of the PAA, r 208(1) of the FJR). Even where domicile is proved, the court retains a discretion to refuse to reseal the grant.' So resealing requires: (1) filing an application (ex parte OS), (2) evidence of domicile, (3) court order. The court has discretion to refuse even if domicile is proved (e.g., if there's a caveat, or if the grant is suspicious). The answer incorrectly treats resealing as automatic."

This affidavit is sworn by the witnesses (if available) or other persons present at execution, stating: 'The testator signed in our presence.

Form 53(a) is used when a person with priority to apply for a grant (e.g., named executor, residuary legatee) chooses not to apply, allowing someone else to apply. It has nothing to do with will execution. Execution defects cannot be 'renounced' – they either exist (making the will invalid) or can be explained/overcome (via Affidavit of Due Execution). The answer conflates unrelated concepts.",

The attestation clause serves as evidence of proper execution. When it's missing and other factors (e.g., witnesses' signatures far from testator's) create doubt, the court cannot simply presume compliance. Rule 211 requires affirmative evidence. If the Affidavit of Due Execution confirms proper execution, the will is valid. If no affidavit is filed or the evidence shows improper execution, the will might be denied probate.

In Mustaq, beneficiaries of the estate were allowed to take out minority oppression claims on behalf of the estate against the wrongdoer (the executor and administrator of the estate). A beneficiary may in certain circumstances institute action to recover assets of the estate. Such special circumstances are not confined solely to cases where the personal representative has defaulted in acting to recover the property, and all the circumstances of the case should be considered, including the nature of the assets, the position of the personal representative and the reason for the default of the personal representative.' So the general rule is beneficiaries cannot sue before a grant. But the Wong Moy exception applies when: (1) the estate's assets are at risk, (2) the personal representative has defaulted or cannot act, (3) circumstances make it impossible or inconvenient for the representative to act.

The answer invents a joint-action requirement that doesn't exist for executors (though it does exist for administrators).",
          "D": "This is exactly backwards. The notes state: 'If executors are named in the will... this is sufficient, and can be done even before probate is extracted' versus 'No valid receipt or discharge may be given by an administrator unless he has extracted grant of letters of administration.' So EXECUTORS can issue receipts before the grant, but ADMINISTRATORS cannot. The answer reverses the rule. Why the difference? Executors derive authority from the will (effective at death). Administrators derive authority from the court's grant (effective only when issued). Before the grant, administrators have no authority. The answer is completely wrong."

Here, the estate is worth $6 million, which exceeds $5 million. Therefore, jurisdiction is in the Family Division of the High Court (SGHCF), not the Family Courts. The $5 million threshold is a clear dividing line. Estates worth $5 million or less go to Family Courts. Estates worth more than $5 million go to Family Division of High Court.

Cheo Yeoh v AEL: there is presumption of revocation if the original will is not found (i.e. presumption that it was revoked by T). Can still apply for grant of probate with a copy of the will, but need to satisfy the court that the presumption of revocation is rebutted.' The law presumes that if the testator had the will and it's now missing, the testator destroyed it intending to revoke. To rebut this presumption, the executor must show: (1) the testator did not have access to the will (e.g., stored in bank, with solicitor, and testator didn't retrieve it), (2) the will was destroyed by accident or by third party without testator's knowledge, (3) the testator's conduct/statements showed continued intention for the will to operate.

However, the executor faces the presumption of revocation (Cheo Yeoh v AEL) and must rebut it. If the executor can show the will was lost without the testator's intention to revoke (e.g., destroyed in a fire, stolen, misplaced by solicitor), the court can grant probate of the copy.

This makes sense: if the testator had the will in their possession and it's now missing, the most likely explanation is the testator destroyed it. The existence of a copy doesn't negate this presumption—the testator could have made multiple copies before destroying the original with intent to revoke. The executor must affirmatively rebut the presumption by showing the will was lost without revocatory intent. The answer incorrectly eliminates the presumption.",

Section 9 PAA allows probate of a copy or of the will's contents if sufficiently established.

The will is valid; the original document is just missing. LA (Letters of Administration for intestacy) is inappropriate because there IS a will—it's just being proved via copy instead of original. If probate of the copy is granted, the estate is distributed according to the will's terms, not intestacy. LA would only be appropriate if the executor fails to rebut the presumption (court concludes will was revoked) or if the copy is deemed unreliable.

The applicant must show grounds for removal (e.g., the caveator has no legitimate interest, the challenge is frivolous, the caveator is causing unreasonable delay).

And: 'Failing to ensure that there were sufficient witnesses (Cheo Yeoh & Associates).' Section 6 Wills Act requires a will to be signed by the testator 'in the presence of 2 or more witnesses present at the same time' who then 'subscribe the will in the presence of the testator.' This is a fundamental requirement. A solicitor who drafts a will has a duty to ensure it is properly executed—this includes verifying that two witnesses are present and sign. In Cheo Yeoh & Associates, the solicitors were held negligent for failing to ensure two witnesses. The solicitor's duty extends beyond drafting to ensuring the will is valid. The beneficiaries who would have inherited under the (now invalid) will can sue the solicitor for their losses (the inheritance they didn't receive).

The notes emphasize the high standard expected: 'There should be no room for even the slightest doubt or the slightest possibility of mistake on a solicitor's part' (Low Ah Cheow, [72]). A solicitor who drafts a will is expected to supervise or at least verify proper execution. The testator relies on the solicitor's expertise—the testator may not know the legal requirements (two witnesses, simultaneous presence, etc.). The solicitor cannot abdicate responsibility by saying 'the testator should have known better.' Cheo Yeoh & Associates confirms solicitors are liable for failing to ensure sufficient witnesses. The answer incorrectly shifts responsibility to the lay client.",

The solicitor's duty includes: (1) drafting clearly, (2) ensuring testamentary capacity, (3) avoiding conflicts of interest, (4) supervising or verifying proper execution.

In White v Jones, the House of Lords held that disappointed beneficiaries (who would have inherited under the properly executed will but didn't because of the solicitor's negligence) can sue the solicitor in tort. The solicitor's duty extends to an 'identifiable class' of third parties (the intended beneficiaries). Here, the beneficiaries named in the improperly executed will can sue the solicitor for the value of their lost inheritances. The estate itself might have no loss (it just passes under intestacy instead), but the beneficiaries suffer real loss. The answer incorrectly limits the class of claimants."

Here, the deceased was domiciled in Australia (not Singapore), but owned immovable property in Singapore. Rule 227 FJR provides two options: (1) apply for a grant to administer by Australian law (the law of the domicile), or (2) if no such application is made, Singapore can grant probate limited to the Singapore immovable property. Option (2) applies here. The Singapore court grants probate, but the grant is 'limited' to the Singapore property—it doesn't extend to assets elsewhere. This avoids conflict with the Australian court (which handles the rest of the estate).

The principle of lex situs applies: the law of the place where property is located governs that property. Immovable property (land, buildings) is always governed by lex situs. Here, the Singapore property is subject to Singapore jurisdiction. Rule 227 FJR explicitly allows Singapore to grant probate (limited to the Singapore property) when the deceased died domiciled abroad. The Australian court has jurisdiction over the rest of the estate (Australian assets, movable property following the deceased's domicile), but Singapore has jurisdiction over the Singapore land. The answer incorrectly treats domicile as conferring exclusive worldwide jurisdiction.",

So the executor has choices: (a) reseal the Australian grant (if one exists) under s 47 PAA, (b) apply under r 227(1) for a Singapore grant to administer by Australian law, (c) if no application under (a) or (b), Singapore grants probate limited to Singapore property under r 227(2).

The rule applies when 'deceased died domiciled outside Singapore' and 'the whole of the estate in Singapore consists of immovable property.' Whether the will was executed in Singapore, Australia, or elsewhere doesn't matter. Section 5 Wills Act addresses will execution (a will is valid if executed per lex loci, lex domicilii, or lex patriae), but that's a separate issue (formal validity). Here, the question is about the grant's scope. Rule 227(2) allows a limited grant for Singapore immovable property regardless of where the will was executed.

This is a significant advantage of testacy over intestacy. When property is specifically devised in a will (a specific gift of immovable property to a named beneficiary), the transfer from the estate to the beneficiary is 'by assent'—the executor/trustee formally transfers title to the beneficiary implementing the will's terms. This transfer is exempt from stamp duty regardless of: (1) property value (could be worth millions), (2) how many properties the beneficiary already owns (ABSD would normally apply for second/subsequent properties), (3) whether the beneficiary is a citizen, PR, or foreigner. This exemption applies because it's giving effect to the deceased's testamentary disposition, not a commercial transaction.",

If the same son purchased the same property from a third party, ad valorem stamp duty (tiered rates up to 6%) and ABSD (tiered rates for second/subsequent properties, up to 30% for foreigners) would apply.

All saved by the will exemption. The answer incorrectly applies commercial transaction stamp duty to testamentary transfers.",

ABSD was introduced to curb property speculation—it imposes higher stamp duty on purchases of second/subsequent residential properties. But a will transfer is not a 'purchase' or speculative acquisition. It's giving effect to the deceased's wishes. The son is not 'buying' the property; he's receiving it by inheritance. So ABSD doesn't apply. The answer incorrectly carves out ABSD from the exemption.",

The exemption applies to ANY specific devise of property in a will, whether the beneficiary is an only child, one of ten children, or a non-relative. The policy is to facilitate testamentary transfers without tax burden, encouraging will-making. If stamp duty applied selectively (only for only children), testators might avoid wills, leading to intestacy problems. The answer invents a limitation that doesn't exist."

The notes state: 'The transfer by intestate succession may result in beneficiaries, having to execute a subsequent Deed of Family Arrangement in order to redistribute the estate according to the deceased's wishes. This will result in very high ad valorem stamp duty (plus Additional Buyer�s Stamp Duty too) if the transfer of immovable property is involved.' Here, the deceased died intestate. The estate initially distributes per ISA rules (e.g., spouse gets 50%, children split 50%). But the beneficiaries want a different split—perhaps all to the spouse, or unequal shares to children. They execute a Deed of Family Arrangement (a contract between beneficiaries redistributing their entitlements). For immovable property, this involves transfers between beneficiaries—e.g., children transferring their shares to spouse. These transfers attract ad valorem stamp duty (tiered rates on property value) AND ABSD (if recipient already owns property). This can be very costly. Example: $2M property, children transfer to spouse (spouse's second property): $70,800 BSD + $300,000 ABSD (15%) = $370,800. Moral: make a will to avoid this! Will transfers by assent are exempt, but Deeds of Family Arrangement are taxed as inter vivos transfers.",

The notes state: 'This will result in very high ad valorem stamp duty (plus Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty too).' The initial ISA distribution is tax-free (inheritance is not taxed in Singapore—no estate duty). But once the estate has distributed per ISA, the beneficiaries own their shares absolutely. If they then redistribute via Deed of Family Arrangement, that's a transfer between living owners, not an inheritance. For stamp duty purposes, it's like a sale or gift between beneficiaries. Full stamp duty and ABSD apply. The answer incorrectly extends the inheritance exemption to post-distribution rearrangements.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because ABSD applies in addition to ad valorem stamp duty. The notes explicitly state: '(plus Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty too) if the transfer of immovable property is involved.' ABSD applies when a person acquires additional residential property. If the recipient of the property under the Deed of Family Arrangement already owns residential property, ABSD applies (rates: 17% for citizens/PRs acquiring 2nd property, 25% for 3rd and subsequent, 30% for foreigners). This is in addition to the regular ad valorem stamp duty (tiered rates up to 6%). The combined tax can exceed 20% of property value. The answer incorrectly excludes ABSD.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because stamp duty applies to all transfers of immovable property via Deed of Family Arrangement, regardless of the quantum redistributed. There's no '10% threshold' exemption. The notes state stamp duty applies 'if the transfer of immovable property is involved,' without qualification. Even if beneficiaries make minor adjustments (e.g., 5% more to one child), transfers of immovable property attract stamp duty. The Stamp Duties Act imposes duty on instruments effecting property transfers. A Deed of Family Arrangement is such an instrument. The duty is calculated on the property value transferred, not on the deviation from ISA. The answer invents a threshold that doesn't exist."

The personal representative can apply to the Court for commission under s 66 PAA. This rate of commission may be as high as 5% of the value of the assets collected.' Section 66 PAA allows executors and administrators to apply for commission (compensation for their work administering the estate). If the will is silent on remuneration, s 66 applies. The court has discretion to award commission up to 5% of the estate value. Factors the court considers: (1) size and complexity of estate, (2) time and effort expended, (3) executor's skill and responsibility, (4) whether professional executor or family member (professionals typically get higher rates), (5) any difficulties or challenges faced. For simple estates, the rate might be 1-2%. For complex estates (multiple jurisdictions, litigation, business interests), up to 5%. The 5% cap prevents excessive fees. Testators can specify higher or lower remuneration in the will (e.g., 'my executor shall receive $50,000 as remuneration'), which overrides s 66.",

For very complex estates (e.g., multinational assets, contentious litigation, business succession), the court can award up to 5%. A $10 million estate at 5% would yield $500,000 commission—substantial, but justified for complex administration. The answer incorrectly caps commission at 3%, below the statutory maximum.",
          "C": "This is too high. The notes state the maximum is '5% of the value of the assets collected,' not 10%. Ten percent would be excessive and could significantly deplete the estate, leaving less for beneficiaries. The law balances compensating executors for their work with preserving the estate for beneficiaries. Five percent strikes this balance. If the will specifies 10% remuneration, that would be binding (testamentary freedom), but s 66 PAA caps court-awarded commission at 5%. The answer doubles the statutory maximum.",

While the court has discretion within the 0-5% range (considering estate complexity, executor's work, etc.), it cannot exceed 5% under s 66 PAA. If an executor deserves more (e.g., due to extraordinary circumstances), they might argue for additional compensation on other grounds (e.g., quantum meruit for services beyond normal executor duties), but s 66 commission is capped at 5%.

The solicitor has a conflict between duties as advisor (ensuring the will reflects client's true wishes) and personal interest (receiving a substantial gift). The solicitor should: (1) not draft the will, or (2) if appointed executor, decline any gifts, or (3) advise client to get independent advice about the gift and not act in relation to that clause.

Here, the plaintiff filed a defence stating he 'merely insists upon the will being proved in solemn form of law.' This is the exact language from rule 855. By doing so, the plaintiff invokes the costs protection. Even though the will is ultimately found valid, the plaintiff is not ordered to pay the other side's costs (unless the court finds 'no reasonable ground for opposing'). Why this rule? Probate is different from ordinary litigation. Parties have legitimate interests in ensuring wills are properly proved. A plaintiff might have genuine concerns (e.g., doubts about testamentary capacity, knowledge of earlier wills) justifying requiring 'solemn form' proof (full court scrutiny with evidence) rather than 'common form' (administrative grant by Registrar). The rule encourages parties to raise legitimate concerns without fear of adverse costs.",

The answer incorrectly applies general litigation costs principles to the specialized probate context.",

While the plaintiff 'lost' (the will was found valid), rule 855 FJR protects them from adverse costs if they invoked the 'solemn form' provision. The plaintiff didn't make affirmative allegations (e.g., fraud, forgery, lack of capacity) that were proven false. They simply said 'prove the will properly in court.' This is legitimate. The court found the will valid after proper scrutiny – the process worked as intended. The plaintiff isn't penalized with costs for requiring this scrutiny. The answer ignores rule 855's costs protection.",
          "D": "This is too broad. Not all costs in probate actions are borne by the estate. Rule 855 addresses costs when a party opposes a will. If the opposition is successful (will found invalid), the propounder might pay costs. If unsuccessful but the opponent merely insisted on solemn form proof, rule 855 protects them from adverse costs. But if the opponent made unreasonable allegations, they might pay costs. Costs depend on the circumstances and the court's discretion under rule 855.

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "The court grants limited Letters of Administration under section 20 PAA. The notes state: 'Pending any probate action, letters of administration may be granted to such person as the court may appoint, limited so that the administrator shall not be empowered to distribute the estate, and shall be subject to such control by, and direction of, the court as the court thinks fit. (s 20 PAA).' And: 'An application under section 20 of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap. 251) for the grant of administration may be made to the Registrar by originating summons. (FJR r 271(1)).' This is 'administration pending trial.' The probate action disputes who should get the grant (e.g., is the will valid? who are the proper executors/administrators?). While this is being litigated, the estate needs management – assets must be preserved, debts paid, business continued. Section 20 PAA allows the court to appoint an administrator temporarily. The grant is 'limited' – the administrator can collect assets, pay debts, manage the estate, but CANNOT distribute to beneficiaries (because who the beneficiaries are might depend on the probate action's outcome). Once the action concludes, a final grant issues to the person determined entitled.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because the probate action disputes the will's validity or the executor's right to the grant. The notes state: ''probate action': means 'an action for the grant of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate... or for the revocation of such a grant or for a decree pronouncing for or against the validity of an alleged will' (r 252(1) FJR).' If the court granted probate to the executor during the action, it would be prejudging the outcome. The whole point of the action is to determine whether this will is valid and this executor is entitled. Section 20 PAA provides a neutral solution: appoint an administrator (not the disputed executor) to manage the estate pending trial. The answer prematurely resolves the dispute.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because the s 20 grant is specifically limited and temporary, not 'automatically permanent.' The notes state the grant is 'limited so that the administrator shall not be empowered to distribute the estate.' It's a holding measure. Once the probate action concludes, the court determines who is entitled to the final grant (probate to the executor if the will is valid; LA to the proper person if intestate; LA with will annexed if will is valid but no executor). The s 20 administrator's role ends. They might be appointed to the final grant, but that's not automatic – it depends on the court's decision and the statutory priority. The answer incorrectly treats the temporary grant as converting to permanent.",
          "D": "This is insufficient. An injunction alone doesn't allow anyone to manage the estate. The notes emphasize the need for an administrator 'pending any probate action.' Assets need active management: collect rents, pay debts, maintain properties, continue businesses. An injunction just freezes assets – it doesn't authorize anyone to act. Section 20 PAA provides both protection (limited grant, court control) and management (administrator with powers to preserve the estate). The answer focuses on protection but ignores the need for active management."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "A citation to accept or refuse a grant should be issued. The notes state: 'A citation to accept or refuse a grant may be issued at the instance of any person (citor) who would himself be entitled to a grant in the event of the person cited renouncing his right to the grant.' And: 'A citation is used to force some action or step in relation to the taking of the grant to the estate.' The procedure is: (1) the citor (person issuing citation) must first enter a caveat (r 243(4) FJR), (2) issue citation in Form 60, (3) serve personally on the executor (person cited) (r 243(6)), (4) executor must enter appearance within 8 days (r 243(8)). The citation forces the executor to choose: (a) accept the grant and apply for probate, or (b) renounce. If the executor renounces, the citor can then apply for a grant (LA with will annexed, as the next-priority person under s 13(2) PAA). This is useful when an executor is delaying or uncertain. The citor has an interest in moving the administration forward. The citation provides a mechanism to force the executor's hand.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because a caveat prevents a grant from being made, but it doesn't force the executor to choose between accepting or renouncing. The notes state: 'any person having or claiming to have interest may... enter a general caveat, so that no probate or letters of administration shall be granted without notice to the caveator' (s 33 PAA). A caveat is defensive – it prevents the executor from obtaining probate without the caveator's knowledge. But it doesn't compel the executor to act. The executor could simply do nothing, and the caveat would expire after 6 months. The citation is the offensive tool – it forces the executor to respond (accept or renounce). The answer confuses defensive (caveat) with offensive (citation) procedures.",
          "C": "This is premature. Commencing a probate action is for disputes about will validity, testamentary capacity, executor's entitlement, etc. The notes describe probate actions as involving 'allegations of undue influence or duress,' 'fraud or forgery,' 'subsequent marriage which revoked the will,' etc. Here, there's no dispute about the will or the executor's entitlement – the issue is the executor is not acting (delaying or uncertain). The citation is the appropriate procedure to force a decision. If the executor responds to the citation and refuses to accept, the citor can apply for LA with will annexed. If the executor accepts, they apply for probate. A probate action is unnecessary and costly. The answer uses a sledgehammer for a task requiring a scalpel.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because there's no such application or 30-day compulsion procedure. The notes don't mention any court order 'compelling the executor to apply for probate within 30 days.' The citation procedure achieves a similar goal but with a different mechanism. The citation requires the executor to enter appearance within 8 days (not 30), and if they accept, to apply for the grant. But it's not a court order 'compelling' application – it's a process that forces the executor to choose (accept or renounce). The answer invents a procedure."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": {
        "correct": "Probate can be revoked for improper administration. Section 32 PAA provides for revocation of grants in certain circumstances. The test for revocation was articulated in UCH v UVJ [72]: the court will revoke probate if there is improper administration. Jigarlal [12] clarifies: 'undue and improper administration in total disregard of beneficiaries' interests.' This is a high threshold - not every administrative error justifies revocation. The executor must be acting improperly (breach of fiduciary duty, self-dealing, gross negligence) AND in total disregard of beneficiaries' interests (ignoring their rights, refusing to account, deliberately harming them). Example: executor selling estate assets to himself at undervalue, refusing to distribute, concealing information. If established, the court can revoke probate, removing the executor and potentially appointing a replacement administrator. This protects beneficiaries from executor misconduct.",
        "incorrect": {
          "A": "This is incorrect because s 32 PAA specifically allows revocation. Grants are not irrevocable. While probate is a solemn court order, it can be revoked if the executor proves unfit or misconducts. The power to revoke is essential - without it, beneficiaries would be at the mercy of dishonest or incompetent executors. The answer incorrectly treats probate as irrevocable.",
          "C": "This is incorrect because revocation doesn't require beneficiary agreement. Section 32 PAA is a court power exercised based on executor misconduct, not beneficiary consent. If the executor has improperly administered (UCH v UVJ test), the court can and should revoke regardless of whether beneficiaries unanimously request it. One beneficiary can apply for revocation, and if misconduct is proven, the court acts. The answer invents a unanimity requirement.",
          "D": "This is incorrect because revocation and breach of duty claims are different remedies, not mutually exclusive. Beneficiaries can seek revocation under s 32 PAA (removing the executor and halting further harm) AND sue for breach of fiduciary duty (recovering losses from past misconduct). Often both are pursued together. Revocation is preventive (stop future harm); breach action is compensatory (recover past losses). The answer incorrectly treats them as alternatives."

R Mahendran [17] states: For fraud and forgery allegations in probate actions, while the standard of proof remains balance of probabilities (civil standard), 'the evidentiary burden must be at the upper end of the scale' given the seriousness of such allegations. This recognizes: (1) Forgery is a serious allegation (impugns testator's signature, suggests criminal conduct by someone), requiring strong evidence. (2) Standard remains civil (balance of probabilities), not criminal (beyond reasonable doubt). (3) But the evidence must be more compelling than for routine civil disputes. The plaintiff must present cogent, persuasive evidence (handwriting expert reports, circumstantial evidence, motive, opportunity). Nina Kung [12] adds: handwriting evidence should not be the sole evidence - court considers all circumstances. If the plaintiff meets this upper-end burden, will is declared forged and invalid.",

          "C": "This is partially correct but incomplete. While the standard is preponderance/balance of probabilities (civil standard), R Mahendran [17] specifies the evidentiary burden must be at the 'upper end of the scale' for serious allegations like forgery. Treating forgery like any routine civil dispute (e.g., breach of contract) would be inappropriate - the seriousness requires more persuasive evidence. The answer is correct on the basic standard but omits the heightened evidentiary burden.",
